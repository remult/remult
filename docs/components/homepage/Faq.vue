    question: 'Is remult an ORM?',
    answer: `<p>Remult is also an ORM! But not limited to! <i>That's just the tip of the iceberg! üèîÔ∏è</i></p>
    <p>Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for full-stack devs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>REST out of the box, and you can add GraphQL, swagger, ...</li>
      <li>Built-in validation mechanism, you don't need Zod, or yop, or joi, or ...</li>
      <li>Metadata to have SSoT (Single Source of Truth) for eveything: labels, permissions, auth, ...</li>
      <li>And yes, you don't need Prisma or Drizzle anymore!</li>
    </ul>`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use Remult in my existing app?',
    answer: `<p>Absolutely! üöÄ</p>
    <p>No need to rewrite everything overnight. Just:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add Remult to your current stack</li>
      <li>Implement the "getUser" function</li>
      <li>Start using it alongside your existing code</li>
    </ol>
    <p>One of our users migrated their project over a year, and guess what? 
    They ended up with 75% less code! Talk about a productivity boost! üí™</p>`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is it different from other libs?',
    answer: `<p>Remult stands out in several key ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's fully yours - we don't host anything for you! You are in full control of your application and data</li>
      <li>We provide a complete toolkit for managing your full application, including ready-to-use Live Queries</li>
      <li>Unlike many other solutions, Remult gives you the freedom to build exactly what you need without vendor lock-in</li>
    </ul>`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it Scale?',
    answer: `<p>Scaling is a common concern, but it's important to ask: Scale in what direction?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of users? ‚úÖ</li>
      <li>Number of recurring users? ‚úÖ</li>
      <li>Time spent by users? ‚úÖ</li>
      <li>Database size? ‚úÖ</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yes, Remult scales in all these directions and more! Join our community to share your scaling metrics and learn from others' experiences üöÄ</p>`,

  {
    question: 'Missing something?',
    answer: `We're always looking for ways to improve Remult.
