# Backend methods

When performing operations on multiple entity objects, performance considerations may necessitate running them on the server. **With Remult, moving client-side logic to run on the server is a simple refactoring**.

## Set All Tasks as Un/completed

Let's add two buttons to the todo app: "Set all as completed" and "Set all as uncompleted".

1. Add a `setAllCompleted` async function to the `Todo` function component, which accepts a `completed` boolean argument and sets the value of the `completed` field of all the tasks accordingly.

   ```ts
   // src/components/todo.tsx

   const setAllCompleted = async (completed: boolean) => {
     for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
       await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
     }
   }
   ```

   The `for` loop iterates the array of `Task` objects returned from the backend, and saves each task back to the backend with a modified value in the `completed` field.

2. Add the two buttons to the return section of the `Todo` component, just before the closing `</main>` tag. Both of the buttons' `onClick` events will call the `setAllCompleted` method with the appropriate value of the `completed` argument.

   ```tsx
   // src/components/todo.tsx

   <div>
     <button onClick={() => setAllCompleted(true)}>Set All Completed</button>
     <button onClick={() => setAllCompleted(false)}>Set All Uncompleted</button>
   </div>
   ```

Make sure the buttons are working as expected before moving on to the next step.

## Refactor from Front-end to Back-end

With the current state of the `setAllCompleted` function, each modified task being saved causes an API `PUT` request handled separately by the server. As the number of tasks in the todo list grows, this may become a performance issue.

A simple way to prevent this is to expose an API endpoint for `setAllCompleted` requests, and run the same logic on the server instead of the client.

1. Create a new `TasksController` class, in the `shared` folder, and refactor the `for` loop from the `setAllCompleted` function of the `Todo` function component into a new, `static`, `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController` class, which will run on the server.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

import { BackendMethod, remult } from 'remult'
import { Task } from './Task'

export class TasksController {
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
    const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task)

    for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
      await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
    }
  }
}
```

The `@BackendMethod` decorator tells Remult to expose the method as an API endpoint (the `allowed` property will be discussed later on in this tutorial).

**Unlike the front-end `Remult` object, the server implementation interacts directly with the database.**

2. Register `TasksController` by adding it to the `controllers` array of the `options` object passed to `createRemultServer()`, in the server's `api` module:

```ts{4,8}
// src/api.ts

//...
import { TasksController } from "./shared/TaskController"

export const api = remultApi({
  //...
  controllers: [TasksController]
})
```

3. Replace the `for` iteration in the `setAllCompleted` function of the `Todo` component with a call to the `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController`.

```tsx{4}
// src/components/todo.tsx

const setAllCompleted = async (completed: boolean) => {
  await TasksController.setAllCompleted(completed)
}
```

::: warning Import TasksController
Remember to add an import of `TasksController` in `src/components/todo.tsx`.

::: tip Note
With Remult backend methods, argument types are compile-time checked. :thumbsup:

After the browser refreshed, the _"Set all..."_ buttons function exactly the same, but much faster.
