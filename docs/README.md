features:
- title: API Included
  details: Secure API is auto-generated from model TypeScript classes, and consumed by frontend type-safe queries. The generated API can also be used by apps & third-parties.

  details: Simple CRUD from frontend to database just works. Smart hooks make it super easy to control data transformation, validations and CRUD events.

- title: Highly Declarative
  details: Model metadata and declarative code affect both frontend and backend, eliminating redundant, error-prone duplication.

- title: Always Type-safe 
  details: The same type-safe coding style can be used to find and manipulate data in both frontend and backend code. 

- title: UI Framework Agnostic
  details: Use Remult together with React, Angular, Vue.js, or any other UI framework.

- title: Easy Setup
  details: Bootstrap in minutes with an Express.js middleware in the backend and an http client wrapper in the frontend.
