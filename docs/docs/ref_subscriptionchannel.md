# SubscriptionChannel

The `SubscriptionChannel` class is used to send messages from the backend to the frontend,
using the same mechanism used by live queries.

#### example:

```ts
// Defined in code that is shared between the frontend and the backend
const statusChange = new SubscriptionChannel<{
  oldStatus: number
  newStatus: number
}>('statusChange')

// Backend: Publishing a message
statusChange.publish({ oldStatus: 1, newStatus: 2 })

// Frontend: Subscribing to messages
statusChange.subscribe((message) => {
  console.log(
    `Status changed from ${message.oldStatus} to ${message.newStatus}`,
  )
})

// Note: If you want to publish from the frontend, use a BackendMethod for that.
```
