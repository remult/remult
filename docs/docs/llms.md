# Docs for LLMs

We support the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) convention for making documentation available to large language models and the applications that make use of them.

Currently, we have the these different levels:

- [/llms.txt](/llms.txt) — a listing of the available files
- [/llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) — complete documentation for remult with all tutorials
