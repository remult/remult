# Admin UI

Enjoy a fully featured Admin UI for your entities, you can do CRUD operations on your entities, view their relationships via the Diagram entry, and ensure secure management with the same validations and authorizations as your application.

## Enabling the Admin UI

Add the Admin UI to your application by setting the `admin` option to `true` in the remult configuration.

```ts
export const api = remultExpress({
  entities: [],
  admin: true, // Enable the Admin UI
})
```

### Tunning the Admin UI

You can pass some options to admin as well:

- `allow`, using [allowed](https://remult.dev/docs/access-control). `true`, `"admin"`, ...
- `customHtmlHead`, to add custom html to the head of the admin page. It's a function that receives remult as an argument.

Example:

```ts
export const api = remultExpress({
  entities: [],
  admin: {
    allow: 'admin', // Only for user having the "admin" role
    customHtmlHead: (r) =>
      `<title>Nice Admin! (${r.user?.name ?? 'Anonymous'})</title>
       <link href="https://remult.dev/favicon.png" rel="icon" type="image/png">`,
  },
})
```

## Accessing and Using the Admin UI

Navigate to `/api/admin` to access the Admin UI. Here, you can perform CRUD operations on your entities, view their relationships via the Diagram entry, and ensure secure management with the same validations and authorizations as your application.
