# Getting Started - Introduction

**Remult** is a fullstack CRUD framework that uses your TypeScript model types to provide:

- Secure REST API (highly configurable)
- Type-safe frontend API client
- Type-safe backend query builder

#### Use the same model classes for both frontend and backend code

With Remult it is simple to keep your code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and increase development speed and maintainability by defining a single TypeScript model class (for each domain object) and sharing it between your frontend and backend code.

As Remult is "aware" of the runtime context (frontend or backend), data validations and entity lifecycle hooks can be written in layer-agnostic TypeScript which will run, as needed, on either the frontend, the backend, or both.

## What you get ?

<!-- Remult offers a streamlined project creation process that caters to over `180` different project flavors, ensuring you'll find the perfect setup for your needs. With just a few simple questions, you will get a fully functional Remult project up and running in no time.

Here's what you can expect: -->

### 1. **Tailored Setup**

Answer a few questions about your preferred tech stack and project requirements.

`Project name`: The name of your project _(it will create a folder with this name)_

`Choose your Framework` <Example :oneline=true :react=true :angular=true :vue=true :nextjs=true :svelte=true :nuxt=true />

`Choose your Web Server` _(if needed)_ <Example :oneline=true :express=true :fastify=true />

`Choose your Database` <Example :oneline=true :json=true :postgres=true :mysql=true :sqlite=true :mongodb=true :mssql=true />

`Authentication`: Do you want to add `auth.js` to your project directly ? including a complete implementation for `credentials` and `github` providers

`Add CRUD demo`: A comprehensive example of how to use an entity. It will show you how to create, read, update and delete data.

`Admin UI`: Will then be available at `/api/admin`

### 2. **Instant Configuration**

Based on your answers, Remult will configure the project with the best-suited options. With all combinations of frameworks, servers, databases and authentication, we manage more than `180 different project flavors`! We are missing yours? Let us know !

### Experience Remult with an Interactive Tutorial

For a guided, hands-on experience, [try our interactive online tutorial](https://learn.remult.dev/). It's the fastest way to get up and running with Remult and understand its powerful features.

## Installation

The _remult_ package is all you need for both frontend and backend code. If you're using one `package.json` for both frontend and backend (or a meta-framework) - **install Remult once** in the project's root folder. If you're using multiple `package.json` files (monorepo) - **install Remult in both server and client folders**.

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm install remult
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add remult
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add remult
```

```sh [bun]
bun add remult
```

:::

## Server-side Initialization

Remult is initialized on the server-side as a request handling middleware, with **a single line of code**. Here is the code for setting up the Remult middleware:

::: code-group

```ts [Express]
import express from 'express'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'

const app = express()

app.use(remultExpress({})) // [!code highlight]

app.listen(3000)
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```ts [Fastify]
import fastify from 'fastify'
import { remultFastify } from 'remult/remult-fastify'

(async () => {
  const server = fastify()

  await server.register(remultFastify({})) // [!code highlight]

  server.listen({ port: 3000 })
})()
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```ts [Next.js]
// src/app/api/[...remult]/route.ts

import { remultNextApp } from 'remult/remult-next'

export const api = remultNextApp({}) // [!code highlight]

export const { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE } = api
```

```ts [Sveltekit]
// src/routes/api/[...remult]/+server.ts

import { remultSveltekit } from 'remult/remult-sveltekit'

export const _api = remultSveltekit({}) // [!code highlight]

export const { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE } = _api
```

```ts [nuxt.js]
// server/api/[...remult].ts

import { remultNuxt } from 'remult/remult-nuxt'

export const api = remultNuxt({})

export default defineEventHandler(api)

// enable experimental decorators
// Add to nuxt.config.ts
  nitro: {
    esbuild: {
      options: {
        tsconfigRaw: {
          compilerOptions: {
            experimentalDecorators: true,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  vite: {
    esbuild: {
      tsconfigRaw: {
        compilerOptions: {
          experimentalDecorators: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },


```

```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```ts [Hono]
import { Hono } from 'hono'

import { remultHono } from 'remult/remult-hono'

const app = new Hono()

const api = remultHono({}) // [!code highlight]
app.route('', api) // [!code highlight]

serve(app)
```

```ts [Nest]
// src/main.ts

import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)

  app.use(remultExpress({})) // [!code highlight]

  await app.listen(3000)
}
bootstrap()
```

```ts{9-17} [Koa]
import * as koa from 'koa'
import * as bodyParser from 'koa-bodyparser'
import { createRemultServer } from 'remult/server'

const app = new koa()

app.use(bodyParser())

const api = createRemultServer({})

app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  const r = await api.handle(ctx.request)
  if (r) {
    ctx.response.body = r.data
    ctx.response.status = r.statusCode
  } else return await next()
})

app.listen(3000, () => {})
```

:::

## Connecting a Database

Use the `dataProvider` property of Remult's server middleware to set up a database connection for Remult.

::: tip Recommended - Use default local JSON files and connect a database later
If the `dataProvider` property is not set, Remult stores data as JSON files under the `./db` folder.
:::

Here are examples of connecting to some commonly used back-end databases:

::: tabs

== Postgres
Install node-postgres:

```sh
npm i pg
```

Set the `dataProvider` property:

```ts{3,7,11-15}
import express from "express"
import { remultExpress } from "remult/remult-express"
import { createPostgresDataProvider } from "remult/postgres"

const app = express()

const connectionString = "postgres://user:password@host:5432/database"

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider:
      createPostgresDataProvider({
        connectionString, // default: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]
        // configuration: {} // optional = a `pg.PoolConfig` object or "heroku"
      })
  })
)
```

Or use your existing postgres connection

```ts
import { Pool } from 'pg'
import { SqlDatabase } from 'remult'
import { PostgresDataProvider } from 'remult/postgres'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
const pg = new Pool({
  connectionString: '....',

  })
)
```

:::

## Integrate Auth

**Remult is completely unopinionated when it comes to user authentication.** You are free to use any kind of authentication mechanism, and only required to provide Remult with a [`getUser`](./ref_remultserveroptions.md#getuser) function that extracts a user object (which implements the minimal Remult `UserInfo` interface) from a request.

Here are examples of integrating some commonly used auth providers:

::: code-group

```ts [express-session]
import express from 'express'
import session from 'express-session'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'

const app = express()

app.use(
  session({
    /* ... */
  }),
)

app.post('/api/signIn', (req, res) => {
  req.session!['user'] = { id: 1, name: 'admin', roles: ['admin'] }
})

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    getUser: (req) => req.session!['user'], // [!code highlight]
  }),
)
```

```ts{8-13} [next-auth]
// src/app/api/[...remult]/route.ts

import { remultNextApp } from 'remult/remult-next'
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'
import { authOptions } from '../auth/[...nextauth]/route'

export const api = remultNextApp({
  getUser: async () => {
    const user = (await getServerSession(authOptions))?.user
    return user?.email && user?.name
      ? { id: user?.email, name: user?.name }
      : undefined
  },
})

export const { POST, PUT, DELETE, GET, withRemult } = api
```

:::

## Defining and Serving an Entity

Remult entity classes are shared between frontend and backend code.

```ts
// shared/product.ts

import { Entity, Fields } from 'remult'

@Entity('products', {
  allowApiCrud: true,
  allowApiDelete: 'admin',
})
export class Product {
  @Fields.uuid()
  id!: string

  @Fields.string()
  name = ''

  @Fields.number()
  unitPrice = 0
}
```

Alternatively, [generate entities](./entities-codegen-from-db-schema.md) from an existing Postgres database.

### Serve Entity CRUD API

All Remult server middleware options contain an [`entities`](./ref_remultserveroptions.md#entities) array. Use it to register your Entity.

```ts
// backend/index.ts

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    entities: [Product], // [!code highlight]
  }),
)
```

## Using your Entity on the Client

To start querying and mutating data from the client-side using Remult, use the [`remult.repo`](./ref_remult.md#repo) function to create a [`Repository`](./ref_repository.md) object for your entity class. This approach simplifies data operations, allowing you to interact with your backend with the assurance of type safety.

```ts
// frontend/code.ts

import { remult } from 'remult'
import { Product } from '../shared/product'

const productsRepo = remult.repo(Product)

async function playWithRemult() {
  // add a new product to the backend database
  await productsRepo.insert({ name: 'Tofu', unitPrice: 5 })

  // fetch products from backend database
  const products = await productsRepo.find({
    where: { unitPrice: { '>=': 5 } },
    orderBy: { name: 'asc' },
    limit: 10,
  })
  console.log(products)

  // update product data
  const tofu = products.filter((p) => p.name === 'Tofu')
  await productsRepo.save({ ...tofu, unitPrice: tofu.unitPrice + 5 })

  // delete product
  await productsRepo.delete(tofu)
}

playWithRemult()
```

## Client-side Customization

::: tip Recommended Defaults
By default, remult uses the browser's [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), and makes data API calls using the base URL `/api` (same-origin).
:::

### Changing the default API base URL

To use a different origin or base URL for API calls, set the remult object's `apiClient.url` property.

```ts
remult.apiClient.url = 'http://localhost:3002/api'
```

### Using an alternative HTTP client

Set the `remult` object's `apiClient.httpClient` property to customize the HTTP client used by Remult:

::: code-group

```ts [Axios instead of Fetch]
import axios from 'axios'
import { remult } from 'remult'

remult.apiClient.httpClient = axios
```

```ts [Angular HttpClient instead of Fetch]
//...
import { HttpClientModule, HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'
import { remult } from 'remult'

@NgModule({
  //...
  imports: [
    //...
    HttpClientModule,
  ],
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(http: HttpClient) {
    remult.apiClient.httpClient = http
  }
}
```

# Entities - Fields

# Field Types

## Common field types

There are also several built in Field decorators for common use case:

### @Fields.string

A field of type string

```ts
@Fields.string()
title = '';
```

### @Fields.number

Just like TypeScript, by default any number is a decimal (or float).

```ts
@Fields.number()
price = 1.5
```

### @Fields.integer

For cases where you don't want to have decimal values, you can use the `@Fields.integer` decorator

```ts
@Fields.integer()
quantity = 0;
```

### @Fields.boolean

```ts
@Fields.boolean()
completed = false
```

### @Fields.date

```ts
@Fields.date()
statusDate = new Date()
```

### @Fields.dateOnly

Just like TypeScript, by default any `Date` field includes the time as well.
For cases where you only want a date, and don't want to meddle with time and time zone issues, use the `@Fields.dateOnly`

```ts
@Fields.dateOnly()
birthDate?:Date;
```

### @Fields.createdAt

Automatically set on the backend on insert, and can't be set through the API

```ts
@Fields.createdAt()
createdAt = new Date()
```

### @Fields.updatedAt

Automatically set on the backend on update, and can't be set through the API

```ts
@Fields.updatedAt()
updatedAt = new Date()
```

## JSON Field

You can store JSON data and arrays in fields.

```ts
@Fields.json()
tags: string[] = []
```

## Auto Generated Id Field Types

### @Fields.uuid

This id value is determined on the backend on insert, and can't be updated through the API.

```ts
@Fields.uuid()
id:string
```

### @Fields.cuid

This id value is determined on the backend on insert, and can't be updated through the API.
Uses the [@paralleldrive/cuid2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paralleldrive/cuid2) package

```ts
@Fields.cuid()
id:string
```

### @Fields.autoIncrement

This id value is determined by the underlying database on insert, and can't be updated through the API.

```ts
@Fields.autoIncrement()
id:number
```

### MongoDB ObjectId Field

To indicate that a field is of type object id, change it's `fieldTypeInDb` to `dbid`.

```ts
@Fields.string({
  dbName: '_id',
  valueConverter: {
    fieldTypeInDb: 'dbid',
  },
})
id: string = ''
```

## Enum Field

Enum fields allow you to define a field that can only hold values from a specific enumeration. The `@Fields.enum` decorator is used to specify that a field is an enum type. When using the `@Fields.enum` decorator, an automatic validation is added that checks if the value is valid in the specified enum.

```ts
@Fields.enum(() => Priority)
priority = Priority.Low;
```

In this example, the `priority` field is defined as an enum type using the `@Fields.enum` decorator. The `Priority` enum is passed as an argument to the decorator, ensuring that only valid `Priority` enum values can be assigned to the `priority` field. The `Validators.enum` validation is used and ensures that any value assigned to this field must be a member of the `Priority` enum, providing type safety and preventing invalid values.

## Literal Fields (Union of string values)

Literal fields let you restrict a field to a specific set of string values using the `@Fields.literal` decorator. This is useful for fields with a finite set of possible values.

```ts
@Fields.literal(() => ['open', 'closed', 'frozen', 'in progress'] as const)
status: 'open' | 'closed' | 'frozen' | 'in progress' = 'open';
```

In this example, we use the `as const` assertion to ensure that the array `['open', 'closed', 'frozen', 'in progress']` is treated as a readonly array, which allows TypeScript to infer the literal types 'open', 'closed', 'frozen', and 'in progress' for the elements of the array. This is important for the type safety of the `status` field.

The `status` field is typed as `'open' | 'closed' | 'frozen' | 'in progress'`, which means it can only hold one of these string literals. The `@Fields.literal` decorator is used to specify that the `status` field can hold values from this set of strings, and it uses the `Validators.in` validator to ensure that the value of `status` matches one of the allowed values.

For better reusability and maintainability, and to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, it is recommended to refactor the literal type and the array of allowed values into separate declarations:

```ts
const statuses = ['open', 'closed', 'frozen', 'in progress'] as const;
type StatusType = typeof statuses[number];

@Fields.literal(() => statuses)
status: StatusType = 'open';
```

In this refactored example, `statuses` is a readonly array of the allowed values, and `StatusType` is a type derived from the elements of `statuses`. The `@Fields.literal` decorator is then used with the `statuses` array, and the `status` field is typed as `StatusType`. This approach makes it easier to manage and update the allowed values for the `status` field, reducing duplication and making the code more robust and easier to maintain.

## ValueListFieldType

### Overview

The `ValueListFieldType` is useful in cases where simple enums and unions are not enough, such as when you want to have more properties for each value. For example, consider representing countries where you want to have a country code, description, currency, and international phone prefix.

### Defining a ValueListFieldType

Using enums or union types for this purpose can be challenging. Instead, you can use the `ValueListFieldType`:

```ts
@ValueListFieldType()
export class Country {
  static us = new Country('us', 'United States', 'USD', '1')
  static canada = new Country('ca', 'Canada', 'CAD', '1')
  static france = new Country('fr', 'France', 'EUR', '33')

  constructor(
    public id: string,
    public caption: string,
    public currency: string,
    public phonePrefix: string,
  ) {}
}
```

### Using in an Entity

In your entity, you can define the field as follows:

```ts
@Field(() => Country)
country: Country = Country.us;
```

### Accessing Properties

The property called `id` will be stored in the database and used through the API, while in the code itself, you can use each property:

```ts
call('+' + person.country.phonePrefix + person.phone)
```

Note: Only the `id` property is saved in the database and used in the API. Other properties, such as `caption`, `currency`, and `phonePrefix`, are only accessible in the code and are not persisted in the database.

### Getting Optional Values

To get the optional values for `Country`, you can use the `getValueList` function, which is useful for populating combo boxes:

```ts
console.table(getValueList(Country))
```

### Special Properties: id and caption

The `id` and `caption` properties are special in that the `id` will be used to save and load from the database, and the `caption` will be used as the display value.

### Automatic Generation of id and caption

If `id` and/or `caption` are not provided, they are automatically generated based on the static member name. For example:

```ts
@ValueListFieldType()
export class TaskStatus {
  static open = new TaskStatus() // { id: 'open', caption: 'Open' }
  static closed = new TaskStatus() // { id: 'closed', caption: 'Closed' }

  id!: string
  caption!: string
  constructor() {}
}
```

In this case, the `open` member will have an `id` of `'open'` and a `caption` of `'Open'`, and similarly for the `closed` member.

### Handling Partial Lists of Values

In cases where you only want to generate members for a subset of values, you can use the `getValues` option of `@ValueListFieldType` to specify which values should be included:

```ts
@ValueListFieldType({
  getValues: () => [
    Country.us,
    Country.canada,
    Country.france,
    { id: 'uk', caption: 'United Kingdom', currency: 'GBP', phonePrefix: '44' }
  ]
})
```

This approach is useful when you want to limit the options available for a field to a specific subset of values, without needing to define all possible values as static members.

::: warning Warning: TypeScript may throw an error similar to `Uncaught TypeError: Currency_1 is not a constructor`.
This happens in TypeScript versions <5.1.6 and target es2022. It's a TypeScript bug. To fix it, upgrade to version >=5.1.6 or change the target from es2022. Alternatively, you can call the `ValueListFieldType` decorator as a function after the type:

```ts
export class TaskStatus {
  static open = new TaskStatus()
  static closed = new TaskStatus()

  id!: string
  caption!: string
  constructor() {}
}
ValueListFieldType()(TaskStatus)
```

:::

### Summary

The `ValueListFieldType` enables the creation of more complex value lists that provide greater flexibility and functionality for your application's needs beyond what enums and unions can offer. By allowing for additional properties and partial lists of values, it offers a versatile solution for representing and managing data with multiple attributes.

## Control Field Type in Database

In some cases, you may want to explicitly specify the type of a field in the database. This can be useful when you need to ensure a specific data type or precision for your field. To control the field type in the database, you can use the `fieldTypeInDb` option within the `valueConverter` property of a field decorator.

For example, if you want to ensure that a numeric field is stored as a decimal with specific precision in the database, you can specify the `fieldTypeInDb` as follows:

```ts
@Fields.number({
  valueConverter: {
    fieldTypeInDb: 'decimal(16,8)'
  }
})
price=0;
```

In this example, the `price` field will be stored as a `decimal` with 16 digits in total and 8 digits after the decimal point in the database. This allows you to control the storage format and precision of numeric fields in your database schema.

## Creating Custom Field Types

Sometimes, you may need to create custom field types to handle specific requirements or use cases in your application. By creating custom field types, you can encapsulate the logic for generating, validating, and converting field values.

### Example: Creating a Custom ID Field Type with NanoID

NanoID is a tiny, secure, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator. You can create a custom field type using NanoID to generate unique IDs for your entities. Here's an example of how to create a custom NanoID field type:

```typescript
import { nanoid } from 'nanoid'
import { Fields, type FieldOptions } from 'remult'

export function NanoIdField<entityType = any>(
  ...options: FieldOptions<entityType, string>[]
) {
  return Fields.string<entityType>(
    {
      allowApiUpdate: false, // Disallow updating the ID through the API
      defaultValue: () => nanoid(), // Generate a new NanoID as the default value
      saving: (_, record) => {
        if (!record.value) {
          record.value = nanoid() // Generate a new NanoID if the value is not set
        }
      },
    },
    ...options,
  )
}
```

In this example, the `NanoIdField` function creates a custom field type based on the `Fields.string` type. It uses the `nanoid` function to generate a unique ID as the default value and ensures that the ID is generated before saving the record if it hasn't been set yet. This custom field type can be used in your entities to automatically generate and assign unique IDs using NanoID.

## Customize DB Value Conversions

Sometimes you want to control how data is saved to the db, or the dto object.
You can do that using the `valueConverter` option.

For example, the following code will save the `tags` as a comma separated string in the db.

```ts
@Fields.object<Task, string[]>({
  valueConverter: {
    toDb: x => (x ? x.join(",") : undefined),
    fromDb: x => (x ? x.split(",") : undefined)
  }
})
tags: string[] = []
```

You can also refactor it to create your own FieldType

```ts
import { Field, FieldOptions, Remult } from 'remult'

export function CommaSeparatedStringArrayField<entityType = any>(
  ...options: (
    | FieldOptions<entityType, string[]>
    | ((options: FieldOptions<entityType, string[]>, remult: Remult) => void)
  )[]
) {
  return Fields.object(
    {
      valueConverter: {
        toDb: (x) => (x ? x.join(',') : undefined),
        fromDb: (x) => (x ? x.split(',') : undefined),
      },
    },
    ...options,
  )
}
```

And then use it:

```ts{9}
@CommaSeparatedStringArrayField()
tags: string[] = []
```

There are several ready made valueConverters included in the `remult` package, which can be found in `remult/valueConverters`

## Class Fields

Sometimes you may want a field type to be a class, you can do that, you just need to provide an implementation for its transition from and to JSON.

For example:

```ts
export class Phone {
  constructor(public phone: string) {}
  call() {
    window.open('tel:' + this.phone)
  }
}

@Entity('contacts')
export class Contact {
  //...
  @Field<Contact, Phone>(() => Phone, {
    valueConverter: {
      fromJson: (x) => (x ? new Phone(x) : undefined!),
      toJson: (x) => (x ? x.phone : undefined!),
    },
  })
  phone?: Phone
}
```

Alternatively you can decorate the `Phone` class with the `FieldType` decorator, so that whenever you use it, its `valueConverter` will be used.

```ts
@FieldType<Phone>({
  valueConverter: {
    fromJson: (x) => (x ? new Phone(x) : undefined!),
    toJson: (x) => (x ? x.phone : undefined!),
  },
})
export class Phone {
  constructor(public phone: string) {}
  call() {
    window.open('tel:' + this.phone)
  }
}

@Entity('contacts')
export class Contact {
  //...
  @Field(() => Phone)
  phone?: Phone
}
```

### Understanding Entity Relations in Remult

In Remult, entity relations play a useful role in modeling and navigating the complex relationships that exist within your data. To illustrate this concept, we will use two primary entities: `Customer` and `Order`. These entities will serve as the foundation for discussing various types of relations and how to define and work with them .

To experiment with these entities online, you can access the following CodeSandbox link, which is preconfigured with these two entities and a postgres database:

[CodeSandbox - Remult Entity Relations Example](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/remult-postgres-demo-f934f8)

Feel free to explore and experiment with the provided entities and their relations in the CodeSandbox environment.

#### Customer Entity

```typescript
// customer.ts

import { Entity, Fields } from 'remult'

@Entity('customers')
export class Customer {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.string()
  name = ''
  @Fields.string()
  city = ''
}
```

The `Customer` entity represents individuals or organizations with attributes such as an ID, name, and city. Each customer can be uniquely identified by their `id`.

#### Order Entity

```typescript
// order.ts

import { Entity, Fields } from 'remult'

@Entity('orders')
export class Order {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.string()
  customer = ''
  @Fields.number()
  amount = 0
}
```

The `Order` entity represents transactions or purchases made by customers. Each order is associated with a `customer`, representing the customer who placed the order, and has an `amount` attribute indicating the total purchase amount.

Throughout the following discussion, we will explore how to define and use relations between these entities, enabling you to create sophisticated data models and efficiently query and manipulate data using Remult. Whether you are dealing with one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships, understanding entity relations is essential for building robust and feature-rich applications with Remult.

## Simple Many-to-One

In Remult, many-to-one relations allow you to establish connections between entities, where multiple records of one entity are associated with a single record in another entity. Let's delve into a common use case of a many-to-one relation, specifically the relationship between the `Order` and `Customer` entities.

### Defining the Relation

To establish a many-to-one relation from the `Order` entity to the `Customer` entity, you can use the `@Relations.toOne()` decorator in your entity definition:

```typescript
// order.ts

import { Entity, Fields, Relations } from 'remult'
import { Customer } from '../customer.js'

@Entity('orders')
export class Order {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.string() // [!code --]
  customer = '' // [!code --]
  @Relations.toOne(() => Customer) // [!code ++]
  customer?: Customer // [!code ++]
  @Fields.number()
  amount = 0
}
```

In this example, each `Order` is associated with a single `Customer`. The `customer` property in the `Order` entity represents this relationship.

### Fetching Relational Data

When querying data that involves a many-to-one relation, you can use the `include` option to specify which related entity you want to include in the result set. In this case, we want to include the associated `Customer` when querying `Order` records.

Here's how you can include the relation in a query using Remult:

```typescript{3-5}
const orderRepo = remult.repo(Order)
const orders = await orderRepo.find({
  include: {
    customer: true,
  },
})
```

#### Resulting Data Structure

The result of the query will contain the related `Customer` information within each `Order` record, creating a nested structure.

Here's an example result of running `JSON.stringify` on the `orders` array:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "adjkzsio3efees8ew0wnsqma",
    "customer": {
      "id": "m4ozs74onwwroav3o1xs1qi8",
      "name": "Larkin - Fadel",
      "city": "London"
    },
    "amount": 90
  },
  {
    "id": "gefhsed1clknmogcgiigo9jo",
    "customer": {
      "id": "m4ozs74onwwroav3o1xs1qi8",
      "name": "Larkin - Fadel",
      "city": "London"
    },
    "amount": 3
  }
]
```

As shown in the result, each `Order` object contains a nested `customer` object, which holds the details of the associated customer, including their `id`, `name`, and `city`. This structured data allows you to work seamlessly with the many-to-one relationship between `Order` and `Customer` entities .

### Querying a Single Item

To retrieve a single `Order` item along with its associated `Customer`, you can use the `findFirst` method provided by your repository (`orderRepo` in this case). Here's an example of how to perform this query:

```typescript
const singleOrder = await orderRepo.findFirst(
  {
    id: 'adjkzsio3efees8ew0wnsqma',
  },
  {
    include: {
      customer: true,
    },
  },
)
```

### Relation Loading

In Remult, by default, a relation is not loaded unless explicitly specified in the `include` statement of a query. This behavior ensures that you only load the related data you require for a specific task, optimizing performance and minimizing unnecessary data retrieval.

Here's an example:

```typescript
const orderRepo = remult.repo(Order)

// Query without including the 'customer' relation
const ordersWithoutCustomer = await orderRepo.find({})
```

In the above query, the `customer` relation will not be loaded and have the value of `undefined` because it is not specified in the `include` statement.

#### Overriding Default Behavior with `defaultIncluded`

Sometimes, you may have scenarios where you want a relation to be included by default in most queries, but you also want the flexibility to exclude it in specific cases. Remult allows you to control this behavior by using the `defaultIncluded` setting in the relation definition.

```typescript
@Relations.toOne(() => Customer, {
  defaultIncluded: true, // [!code ++]
})
customer = "";
```

In this example, we set `defaultIncluded` to `true` for the `customer` relation in the `Order` entity. This means that, by default, the `customer` relation will be loaded in most queries unless explicitly excluded.

#### Example: Excluding `customer` Relation in a Specific Query

```typescript
const orders = await orderRepo.find({
  include: {
    customer: false, // [!code ++]
  },
})
```

In this query, we override the default behavior by explicitly setting `customer: false` in the `include` statement. This instructs Remult not to load the `customer` relation for this specific query, even though it is set to be included by default.

By combining the default behavior with the ability to override it in specific queries, Remult provides you with fine-grained control over relation loading, ensuring that you can optimize data retrieval based on your application's requirements and performance considerations.

## Advanced Many-to-One

In certain scenarios, you may require more granular control over the behavior of relations and want to access specific related data without loading the entire related entity. Remult provides advanced configuration options to meet these requirements. Let's explore how to achieve this level of control through advanced relation configurations.

### Custom Relation Field

In Remult, you can define custom relation fields that allow you to access the `id` without loading the entire related entity. To define a custom relation field, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Define a Custom Field in the Entity

In your entity definition, define a custom field that will hold the identifier or key of the related entity. This field serves as a reference to the related entity without loading the entity itself.

```typescript{5-8}
@Entity("orders")
export class Order {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = "";
  @Fields.string() // [!code ++]
  customerId = ""; // Custom field to hold the related entity's identifier // [!code ++]
  @Relations.toOne<Order, Customer>(() => Customer, "customerId")  // [!code ++]
  @Relations.toOne(() => Customer) // [!code --]
  customer?: Customer;
  @Fields.number()
  amount = 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a custom field called `customerId`, which stores the identifier of the related `Customer` entity.

#### Step 2: Define the Relation Using `toOne`

Use the `@Relations.toOne` decorator to define the relation, specifying the types for the `fromEntity` and `toEntity` in the generic parameters. Additionally, provide the name of the custom field (in this case, `"customerId"`) as the third argument.

```typescript
@Entity('orders')
export class Order {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.string()
  customerId = '' // Custom field to hold the related entity's identifier
  @Relations.toOne<Order, Customer>(() => Customer, 'customerId') // [!code ++]
  customer = ''
  @Fields.number()
  amount = 0
}
```

This configuration establishes a relation between `Order` and `Customer` using the `customerId` field as the reference.

#### Migrating from a Simple `toOne` Relation to a Custom Field Relation with Existing Data

When transitioning from a simple `toOne` relation to a custom field relation in Remult and you already have existing data, it's important to ensure a smooth migration. In this scenario, you need to make sure that the newly introduced custom field (`customerId` in this case) can access the existing data in your database. This is accomplished using the `dbName` option. Here's how to perform this migration:

##### 1. Understand the Existing Data Structure

Before making any changes, it's crucial to understand the structure of your existing data. In the case of a simple `toOne` relation, there may be rows in your database where a field (e.g., `customer`) holds the identifier of the related entity.

##### 2. Define the Custom Field with `dbName`

When defining the custom field in your entity, use the `dbName` option to specify the name of the database column where the related entity's identifier is stored. This ensures that the custom field (`customerId` in this example) correctly accesses the existing data in your database.

```typescript
@Entity('orders')
export class Order {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.string({ dbName: 'customer' }) // Use dbName to match existing data // [!code ++]
  customerId = ''
  @Relations.toOne(() => Customer, 'customerId')
  customer?: Customer
  @Fields.number()
  amount = 0
}
```

In this example, we use the `dbName` option to specify that the `customerId` field corresponds to the `customer` column in the database. This mapping ensures that the custom field can access the existing data that uses the `customer` column for the related entity's identifier.

#### Using the `field` Option for Custom Relation Configuration

When you require additional customization for a relation field in Remult, you can utilize the field option to specify additional options for the related field.

```typescript
@Relations.toOne<Order, Customer>(() => Customer, {
  field: "customerId", // [!code ++]
  caption: "The Customer",
})
```

In this example, we use the `field` option to define a custom relation between the `Order` and `Customer` entities. Here are some key points to understand about using the `field` option:

1. **Custom Relation Field**: The `field` option allows you to specify a custom field name (e.g., `"customerId"`) that represents the relationship between entities. This field can be used to access related data without loading the entire related entity.

2. **Additional Configuration**: In addition to specifying the `field`, you can include other options as well. In this example, we set the `caption` option to provide a descriptive caption for the relation field.

Using the `field` option provides you with granular control over how the relation field is configured and accessed . You can customize various aspects of the relation to meet your specific requirements, enhance documentation, and improve the overall usability of your codebase.

### Relation Based on Multiple Fields

In some scenarios, establishing a relation between entities requires considering multiple fields to ensure the correct association. Remult provides the flexibility to define relations based on multiple fields using the `fields` option. Here's how to create a relation based on multiple fields in Remult:

#### Defining Entities

Let's consider a scenario where both `Order` and `Customer` entities belong to specific branches, and we need also the `branchId` fields to ensure the correct association. First, define your entities with the relevant fields:

```typescript{0}
@Entity('customers')
export class Customer {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.number() // [!code ++]
  branchId = 0 // [!code ++]
  @Fields.string()
  name = ''
  @Fields.string()
  city = ''
}

@Entity('orders')
export class Order {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.number() // [!code ++]
  branchId = 0 // [!code ++]
  @Fields.string({ dbName: 'customer' })
  customerId = ''
  @Relations.toOne<Order, Customer>(() => Customer, {
    fields: {//[!code ++]
      branchId: 'branchId', // Field from Customer entity : Field from Order// [!code ++]
      id: 'customerId', // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
  })
  customer?: Customer
  @Fields.number()
  amount = 0
}
```

In this example, we have two entities: `Customer` and `Order`. Both entities have a `branchId` field that represents the branch they belong to. To create a relation based on these fields, we specify the `fields` option in the relation configuration.

#### Using the `fields` Option

In the `@Relations.toOne` decorator, use the `fields` option to specify the mapping between fields in the related entity (`Customer`) and your entity (`Order`). Each entry in the `fields` object corresponds to a field in the related entity and maps it to a field in your entity.

```typescript
@Relations.toOne<Order, Customer>(() => Customer, {
  fields: {// [!code ++]
    branchId: 'branchId', // Field from Customer entity : Field from Order// [!code ++]
    id: 'customerId',// [!code ++]
  },// [!code ++]
})
customer?: Customer;
```

In this configuration:

- `branchId` from the `Customer` entity is mapped to `branchId` in the `Order` entity.
- `id` from the `Order` entity is mapped to `customerId` in the `Customer` entity.

This ensures that the relation between `Order` and `Customer` is based on both the `branchId` and `customerId` fields, providing a comprehensive association between the entities.

By utilizing the `fields` option, you can create relations that consider multiple fields, ensuring accurate and meaningful associations between your entities in Remult.

## One-to-Many

In Remult, you can easily define a `toMany` relation to retrieve multiple related records. Let's consider a scenario where you want to retrieve a list of orders for each customer. We'll start with the basic `toOne` relation example and then add a `toMany` relation to achieve this:

#### Basic `toOne` Relation Example

First, let's define the `Customer` and `Order` entities with a basic `toOne` relation:

```typescript{9-10}
@Entity("customers")
export class Customer {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = "";
  @Fields.string()
  name = "";
  @Fields.string()
  city = "";
}

@Entity("orders")
export class Order {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = "";
  @Relations.toOne(() => Customer)
  customer?: Customer;
  @Fields.number()
  amount = 0;
}
```

In this initial setup:

- The `Order` entity has a property `customer`, which is decorated with `@Relations.toOne(() => Customer)`. This establishes a relation between an order and its associated customer.

### Adding a `toMany` Relation

Now, let's enhance this setup to include a `toMany` relation that allows you to retrieve a customer's orders:

```typescript
@Entity('customers')
export class Customer {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.string()
  name = ''
  @Fields.string()
  city = ''
  @Relations.toMany(() => Order) // [!code ++]
  orders?: Order[] // [!code ++]
}
```

In this updated configuration:

- The `Customer` entity has a property `orders`, which is decorated with `@Relations.toMany(() => Order)`. This indicates that a customer can have multiple orders.

With this setup, you can use the `orders` property of a `Customer` entity to retrieve all the orders associated with that customer. This provides a convenient way to access and work with a customer's orders.

By defining a `toMany` relation, you can easily retrieve and manage multiple related records, such as a customer's orders.

### Fetching Relational Data

To retrieve customers along with their associated order in Remult, you can use the `include` option in your query. Let's see how to fetch customers with their orders using the `include` option:

```typescript
const customerRepo = remult.repo(Customer)
const customers = await customerRepo.find({
  include: {
    orders: true,
  },
})
```

In this code snippet:

- We first obtain a repository for the `Customer` entity using `remult.repo(Customer)`.

- Next, we use the `find` method to query the `Customer` entity. Within the query options, we specify the `include` option to indicate that we want to include related records.

- Inside the `include` option, we specify `orders: true`, indicating that we want to fetch the associated orders for each customer.

As a result, the `customers` variable will contain an array of customer records, with each customer's associated orders included. This allows you to easily access and work with both customer and order data.

#### Resulting Data Structure

When you fetch customers along with their associated orders using the `include` option in Remult, the result will be an array that includes both customer and order data.

Here's an example result of running `JSON.stringify` on the `customers` array:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "ik68p3oxqg1ygdffpryqwkpw",
    "name": "Fay, Ebert and Sporer",
    "city": "London",
    "orders": [
      {
        "id": "m7m3xqyx4kwjaqcd0cu33q8g",
        "amount": 15
      },
      {
        "id": "rbkcrz6nc45zn4xfxmjise21",
        "amount": 10
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

In this example:

- Each customer is represented as an object with properties such as `id`, `name`, and `city`.

- The `orders` property within each customer object contains an array of associated order records.

- Each order record within the `orders` array includes properties like `id` and `amount`.

This structured result allows you to easily navigate and manipulate the data . You can access customer information as well as the details of their associated orders, making it convenient to work with related records in your application's logic and UI.

### Specifying Reference Fields

In Remult, you can specify a field or fields for `toMany` relations to have more control over how related records are retrieved. This can be useful when you want to customize the behavior of the relation. Here's how you can specify a field or fields for `toMany` relations:

#### Specifying a Single Field

To specify a single field for a `toMany` relation, you can use the `field` option. This option allows you to define the field in your entity that establishes the relation. For example:

```typescript
@Relations.toMany<Customer, Order>(() => Order, {
  field: "customer",
})
```

In this case, the `field` option is set to `"customer"`, indicating that the `customer` field in the `Order` entity establishes the relation between customers and their orders.

#### Specifying Multiple Fields

In some cases, you may need to specify multiple fields to establish a `toMany` relation. To do this, you can use the `fields` option, which allows you to define a mapping of fields between entities. Here's an example:

```typescript
@Relations.toMany<Customer, Order>(() => Order, {
  fields: {
    branchId: "branchId",
    customerId: "id",
  },
})
```

In this example, the `fields` option is used to specify that the `branchId` field in the `Order` entity corresponds to the `branchId` field in the `Customer` entity, and the `customerId` field in the `Order` entity corresponds to the `id` field in the `Customer` entity.

By specifying fields in this manner, you have fine-grained control over how the relation is established and how related records are retrieved. This allows you to tailor the behavior of `toMany` relations to your specific use case and data model.

### Customizing a `toMany` Relation

In Remult, you can exercise precise control over a `toMany` relation by utilizing the `findOptions` option. This option allows you to define specific criteria and behaviors for retrieving related records. Here's how you can use `findOptions` to fine-tune a `toMany` relation:

```typescript
@Relations.toMany<Customer, Order>(() => Order, {
  fields: {
    branchId: "branchId",
    customerId: "id",
  },
  findOptions: {
    limit: 5,
    orderBy: {
      amount: "desc",
    },
    where: {
      amount: { $gt: 10 },
    },
  },
})
```

In this example, we've specified the following `findOptions`:

- `limit: 5`: Limits the number of related records to 5. Only the first 5 related records will be included.

- `orderBy: { amount: "desc" }`: Orders the related records by the `amount` field in descending order. This means that records with higher `amount` values will appear first in the result.

- `where: { amount: { $gt: 10 } }`: Applies a filter to include only related records where the `amount` is greater than 10. This filters out records with an `amount` of 10 or lower.

By using `findOptions` in this manner, you gain precise control over how related records are retrieved and included in your query results. This flexibility allows you to tailor the behavior of the `toMany` relation to suit your specific application requirements and use cases.

#### Fine-Tuning a `toMany` Relation with `include`

In Remult, you can exercise even more control over a `toMany` relation by using the `include` option within your queries. This option allows you to further customize the behavior of the relation for a specific query. Here's how you can use `include` to fine-tune a `toMany` relation:

```typescript
const orders = await customerRepo.find({
  include: {
    orders: {
      limit: 10,
      where: {
        completed: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

In this code snippet:

- We use the `include` option within our query to specify that we want to include the related `orders` for each customer.

- Inside the `include` block, we can provide additional options to control the behavior of this specific inclusion. For example:
  - `limit: 10` limits the number of related orders to 10 per customer. This will override the `limit` set in the original relation.
  - `where: { completed: true }` filters the included orders to only include those that have been marked as completed.

The `where` option specified within `include` will be combined with the `where` conditions defined in the `findOptions` of the relation using an "and" relationship. This means that both sets of conditions must be satisfied for related records to be included.

Using `include` in this way allows you to fine-tune the behavior of your `toMany` relation to meet the specific requirements of each query, making Remult a powerful tool for building flexible and customized data retrieval logic in your application.

## Repository `relations`

In Remult, managing relationships between entities is a crucial aspect of working with your data. When dealing with a `toMany` relationship, Remult provides you with powerful tools through the repository's `relations` property to handle related rows efficiently, whether you want to retrieve them or insert new related records.

### Inserting Related Records

Consider a scenario where you have a `Customer` entity with a `toMany` relationship to `Order` entities. You can create a new customer and insert related orders in a straightforward manner:

```typescript
const customer = await customerRepo.insert({ name: 'Abshire Inc' })
await customerRepo.relations(customer).orders.insert([
  {
    amount: 5,
  },
  {
    amount: 7,
  },
])
```

In this example, you first create a new `Customer` entity with the name "Abshire Inc." Then, using the `relations` method, you access the related `orders`. By calling the `insert` method on the `orders` relation, you can add new order records. Remult automatically sets the `customer` field for these orders based on the specific customer associated with the `relations` call.

### Loading Unfetched Relations

Another powerful use of the `repository` methods is to load related records that were not initially retrieved. Let's say you have found a specific customer and want to access their related orders:

```typescript
const customerRepo = remult.repo(Customer)
const customer = await customerRepo.findFirst({ name: 'Abshire Inc' })
const orders = await customerRepo.relations(customer).orders.find()
```

Here, you first search for a customer with the name "Abshire Inc." After locating the customer, you can use the `relations` method again to access their related orders. By calling the `find` method on the `orders` relation, you retrieve all related order records associated with the customer.

#### Contextual Repository: Tailored Operations for Related Data

The `relations` method serves as a specialized repository, tightly associated with the particular customer you supply to it. This dedicated repository offers a tailored context for performing operations related to the specific customer's connection to orders. It enables you to seamlessly find related records, insert new ones, calculate counts, and perform other relevant actions within the precise scope of that customer's relationship with orders. This versatile capability streamlines the management of intricate relationships in your application, ensuring your data interactions remain organized and efficient.

Remult's repository methods empower you to seamlessly manage and interact with related data, making it easier to work with complex data structures and relationships in your applications. Whether you need to insert related records or load unfetched relations, these tools provide the flexibility and control you need to handle your data efficiently.

Certainly, here's an extension of the "Loading Unfetched Relations" section that covers the topic of fetching unloaded `toOne` relations using the `findOne` function:

---

### Fetching Unloaded `toOne` Relations with `findOne`

In addition to loading unfetched `toMany` relations, Remult offers a convenient way to retrieve `toOne` relations that were not initially loaded. This capability is especially useful when dealing with many-to-one relationships.

Consider the following example, where we have a many-to-one relation between orders and customers. We want to fetch the customer related to a specific order, even if we didn't load it initially:

```ts
const orderRepo = remult.repo(Order)
const order = await orderRepo.findFirst({ id: 'm7m3xqyx4kwjaqcd0cu33q8g' })
const customer = await orderRepo.relations(order).customer.findOne()
```

In this code snippet:

1. We first obtain the order using the `findFirst` function, providing the order's unique identifier.
2. Next, we use the `relations` method to access the repository's relations and then chain the `customer` relation using dot notation.
3. Finally, we call `findOne()` on the `customer` relation to efficiently retrieve the related customer information.

This approach allows you to access and load related data on-demand, providing flexibility and control over your data retrieval process. Whether you're working with loaded or unloaded relations, Remult's intuitive functions give you the power to seamlessly access the data you need.

---

You can seamlessly incorporate this extension into the "Loading Unfetched Relations" section of your documentation to provide a comprehensive overview of working with both `toMany` and `toOne` relations.

---

### Accessing Relations with `activeRecord`

If you're following the `activeRecord` pattern and your entity inherits from `EntityBase` or `IdEntity`, you can access relations directly from the entity instance. This approach offers a convenient and straightforward way to work with relations.

#### Inserting Related Records

You can insert related records directly from the entity instance. For example, consider a scenario where you have a `Customer` entity and a `toMany` relation with `Order` entities. Here's how you can insert related orders for a specific customer:

```ts
const customer = await customerRepo.insert({ name: 'Abshire Inc' })
await customer._.relations.orders.insert([
  {
    amount: 5,
  },
  {
    amount: 7,
  },
])
```

In this code:

- We create a new `Customer` instance using `customerRepo.insert()` and set its properties.
- Using `customer._.relations.orders`, we access the `orders` relation of the customer.
- We insert two orders related to the customer by calling `.insert()` on the `orders` relation.

#### Retrieving Related Records

Fetching related records is just as straightforward. Let's say you want to find a customer by name and then retrieve their related orders:

```ts
const customer = await customerRepo.findFirst({ name: 'Abshire Inc' })
const orders = await customer._.relations.orders.find()
```

In this code:

- We search for a customer with the specified name using `customerRepo.findFirst()`.
- Once we have the customer instance, we access their `orders` relation with `customer._.relations.orders`.
- We use `.find()` to retrieve all related orders associated with the customer.

Using the `activeRecord` pattern and direct access to relations simplifies the management of related data, making it more intuitive and efficient.

## Many-to-Many

In Remult, you can effectively handle many-to-many relationships between entities by using an intermediate table. This approach is especially useful when you need to associate multiple instances of one entity with multiple instances of another entity. In this section, we'll walk through the process of defining and working with many-to-many relationships using this intermediate table concept.

#### Entity Definitions:

To illustrate this concept, let's consider two entities: `Customer` and `Tag`. In this scenario, multiple customers can be associated with multiple tags.

```ts
@Entity('customers')
export class Customer {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.string()
  name = ''
  @Fields.string()
  city = ''
}

@Entity('tags')
export class Tag {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.string()
  name = ''
}
```

### Intermediate Table

To establish this relationship, we'll create an intermediate table called `tagsToCustomers`. In this table, both `customerId` and `tagId` fields are combined as the primary key.

```ts
@Entity<TagsToCustomers>('tagsToCustomers', {
  id: {
    customerId: true,
    tagId: true,
  },
})
export class TagsToCustomers {
  @Fields.string()
  customerId = ''
  @Fields.string()
  tagId = ''
  @Relations.toOne<TagsToCustomers, Tag>(() => Tag, 'tagId')
  tag?: Tag
}
```

- To uniquely identify associations between customers and tags in a many-to-many relationship, we use the combined `customerId` and `tagId` fields as the primary key, specified using the 'id' option in the `@Entity` decorator.

- In this scenario, we've defined a `toOne` relation to the `Tag` entity within the `TagsToCustomers` entity to efficiently retrieve tags associated with a specific customer. This approach simplifies the management of many-to-many relationships while ensuring unique identification of each association.

Now, let's enhance our customer entity with a toMany relationship, enabling us to fetch all of its associated tags effortlessly.

```ts
@Entity('customers')
export class Customer {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''
  @Fields.string()
  name = ''
  @Fields.string()
  city = ''
  @Relations.toMany(() => TagsToCustomers, 'customerId') // [!code ++]
  tags?: TagsToCustomers[] // [!code ++]
}
```

### Working with Many-to-Many Relationships

Let's explore how to interact with many-to-many relationships using an intermediate table in Remult.

#### 1. Adding Tags to a Customer:

To associate a tag with a customer, consider the follow code:

```ts
const tags = await remult
  .repo(Tag)
  .insert([
    { name: 'vip' },
    { name: 'hot-lead' },
    { name: 'influencer' },
    { name: 'manager' },
  ]) // Create the tags

const customerRepo = remult.repo(Customer)
const customer = await customerRepo.findFirst({ name: 'Abshire Inc' })
await customerRepo
  .relations(customer)
  .tags.insert([{ tag: tags[0] }, { tag: tags[2] }])
```

Here's an explanation of what's happening in this code:

1. We first insert some tags into the "tags" entity.

2. We then create a repository instance for the "customer" entity using `remult.repo(Customer)`.

3. We retrieve a specific customer by searching for one with the name "Abshire Inc" using `customerRepo.findFirst({ name: "Abshire Inc" })`. The `customer` variable now holds the customer entity.

4. To associate tags with the customer, we use the `relations` method provided by the repository. This method allows us to work with the customer's related entities, in this case, the "tags" relation to the TagsToCustomers entity.

5. Finally, we call the `insert` method on the "tags" relationship and provide an array of tag objects to insert. In this example, we associate the customer with the "vip" tag and the "influencer" tag by specifying the tags' indices in the `tags` array.

**2. Retrieving Tags for a Customer:**
To fetch the tags associated with a specific customer:

Certainly, here's a shorter explanation:

```ts
const customer = await customerRepo.findFirst(
  { name: 'Abshire Inc' },
  {
    include: {
      tags: {
        include: {
          tag: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
)
```

In this code, we're querying the "customer" entity to find a customer named "Abshire Inc." We're also including the related "tags" for that customer, along with the details of each tag. This allows us to fetch both customer and tag data in a single query, making it more efficient when working with related entities.

### Resulting Data Structure

Here's an example result of running `JSON.stringify` on the `customer` object:

```json
{
  "id": "fki6t24zkykpljvh4jurzs97",
  "name": "Abshire Inc",
  "city": "New York",
  "tags": [
    {
      "customerId": "fki6t24zkykpljvh4jurzs97",
      "tagId": "aewm0odq9758nopgph3x7brt",
      "tag": {
        "id": "cf8xv3myluc7pmsgez3p9hn9",
        "name": "vip"
      }
    },
    {
      "customerId": "fki6t24zkykpljvh4jurzs97",
      "tagId": "aewm0odq9758nopgph3x7brt",
      "tag": {
        "id": "aewm0odq9758nopgph3x7brt",
        "name": "influencer"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Utilizing an intermediate table for managing many-to-many relationships in Remult allows for a flexible and efficient approach to handle complex data associations. Whether you are connecting customers with tags or other entities, this method provides a powerful way to maintain data integrity and perform queries effectively within your application.

---

In this guide, we've explored the essential concepts of managing entity relations within the Remult library. From one-to-one to many-to-many relationships, we've covered the declaration, customization, and querying of these relations. By understanding the nuances of entity relations, users can harness the full potential of Remult to build robust TypeScript applications with ease.

This guided experience offers step-by-step lessons to help you master filtering in Remult with practical examples and exercises.

[Click here to dive into the interactive tutorial on Filtering and Relations!](https://learn.remult.dev/in-depth/4-filtering/1-custom-filters)

:::

In this article, we'll discuss several relevant techniques for one-to-many relations.
Consider the following scenario where we have a customer entity and an Orders entity.

We'll use the following entities and data for this article.

```ts
import { Entity, Field, Fields, remult, Relations } from 'remult'

@Entity('customers')
export class Customer {
  @Fields.autoIncrement()
  id = 0
  @Fields.string()
  name = ''
  @Fields.string()
  city = ''
  @Relations.toMany(() => Order)
  orders?: Order[]
}

@Entity('orders')
export class Order {
  @Fields.autoIncrement()
  id = 0
  @Relations.toOne(() => Customer)
  customer!: Customer
  @Fields.number()
  amount = 0
}
```

::: tip Use Case in this article
Let's say that we want to filter all the orders of customers who are in London.

Let's have a look at the different options to achieve this.
:::

## Option 1 - Use In Statement

Add the `where` inline to the `find` method.

```ts
console.table(
  await repo(Order).find({
    where: {
      customer: await repo(Customer).find({
        where: {
          city: 'London',
        },
      }),
    },
  }),
)
```

## Option 2 - Use Custom Filter

We can refactor this to a custom filter that will be easier to use and will run on the backend

```ts
import { Filter } from 'remult'

@Entity('orders', { allowApiCrud: true })
export class Order {
  //...
  static filterCity = Filter.createCustom<Order, { city: string }>(
    async ({ city }) => ({
      customer: await repo(Customer).find({ where: { city } }),
    }),
  )
}
```

And then we can use it:

```ts
console.table(
  await repo(Order).find({
    where: Order.filterCity({
      city: 'London',
    }),
  }),
)
```

## Option 3 - Custom Filter (SQL)

We can improve on the custom filter by using the database's in statement capabilities:

```ts
import { SqlDatabase } from 'remult'

@Entity('orders', { allowApiCrud: true })
export class Order {
  //...
  static filterCity = Filter.createCustom<Order, { city: string }>(
    async ({ city }) =>
      SqlDatabase.rawFilter(
        ({ param }) =>
          `customer in (select id from customers where city = ${param(city)})`,
      ),
  )
}
```

We can also reuse the entity definitions by using `dbNamesOf` and `filterToRaw`

```ts
import { dbNamesOf } from 'remult'

@Entity('orders', { allowApiCrud: true })
export class Order {
  //...
  static filterCity = Filter.createCustom<Order, { city: string }>(
    async ({ city }) => {
      const orders = await dbNamesOf(Order)
      const customers = await dbNamesOf(Customer)
      return SqlDatabase.rawFilter(
        async ({ filterToRaw }) =>
          `${orders.customer} in 
               (select ${customers.id} 
                  from ${customers} 
                 where ${await filterToRaw(Customer, { city })})`,
      )
    },
  )
}
```

## Option 4 - sqlExpression field

```ts
@Entity('orders', { allowApiCrud: true })
export class Order {
  //...
  @Fields.string<Order>({
    sqlExpression: async () => {
      const customer = await dbNamesOf(Customer)
      const order = await dbNamesOf(Order)
      return `(
          select ${customer.city}
            from ${customer}
           where ${customer.id} = ${order.customer}
          )`
    },
  })
  city = ''
}
```

- This adds a calculated `city` field to the `Order` entity that we can use to order by or filter

```ts
console.table(
  await repo(Order).find({
    where: {
      city: 'London',
    },
  }),
)
```

::: details Side Note
In this option, `city` is always calculated, and the `sqlExpression` is always executed. Not a big deal, but it's woth mentioning. (Check out Option 5 for a solution)
:::

## Option 5 - Dedicated entity

```ts
export class OrderWithCity extends Order {
  @Fields.string<Order>({
    sqlExpression: async () => {
      const customer = await dbNamesOf(Customer)
      const order = await dbNamesOf(Order)
      return `(
          select ${customer.city}
            from ${customer}
           where ${customer.id} = ${order.customer}
          )`
    },
  })
  city = ''
}
```

Like this, in your code, you can use `OrderWithCity` or `Order` depending on your needs.

::: tip
As `OrderWithCity` extends `Order`, everything in `Order` is also available in `OrderWithCity` 🎉.

# Entities - Lifecycle Hooks

# Entity Lifecycle Hooks

In Remult, you can take advantage of Entity Lifecycle Hooks to add custom logic and actions at specific stages of an entity's lifecycle. There are five lifecycle events available: `validation`, `saving`, `saved`, `deleting`, and `deleted`. These hooks allow you to perform actions or validations when specific events occur in the entity's lifecycle.

## Validation

- **Runs On**: Backend and Frontend.
- **Purpose**: To perform validations on the entity's data before saving.
- **Example**:
  ```ts
  @Entity<Task>("tasks", {
    validation: async (task, e) => {
      if (task.title.length < 5) {
        throw new Error("Task title must be at least 5 characters long.");
      }
    },
  })
  ```
  You can run custom validation like in this example, and you can also use [builtin validation](./validation.md).

## Saving

- **Runs On**: Backend (or Frontend if using a local frontend database).
- **Purpose**: To execute custom logic before an entity is saved.
- **Example**:
  ```ts
  @Entity<Task>("tasks", {
    saving: async (task, e) => {
      if (e.isNew) {
        task.createdAt = new Date(); // Set the creation date for new tasks.
      }
      task.lastUpdated = new Date(); // Update the last updated date.
    },
  })
  ```

## Saved

- **Runs On**: Backend (or Frontend if using a local frontend database).
- **Purpose**: To perform actions after an entity has been successfully saved.
- **Example**: Useful for triggering additional processes or updates after saving.

## Deleting

- **Runs On**: Backend (or Frontend if using a local frontend database).
- **Purpose**: To execute custom logic before an entity is deleted.
- **Example**: You can use this to ensure related data is properly cleaned up or archived.

## Deleted

- **Runs On**: Backend (or Frontend if using a local frontend database).
- **Purpose**: To perform actions after an entity has been successfully deleted.
- **Example**: Similar to the `saved` event, this is useful for any post-deletion processes.

## Field Saving Hook

Additionally, you can define a field-specific `saving` hook that allows you to perform custom logic on a specific field before the entity `saving` hook. It has the following signature:

```ts
@Fields.Date<Task>({
  saving: (task, fieldRef, e) => {
    if (e.isNew) task.createdAt = new Date()
  },
})
createdAt = new Date()
```

or using the fieldRef

```ts
@Fields.Date({
  saving: (_, fieldRef, e) => {
    if (e.isNew) fieldRef.value = new Date()
  },
})
createdAt = new Date()
```

You can use the field `saving` hook to perform specialized actions on individual fields during the entity's saving process.

## Lifecycle Event Args

Each lifecycle event receives an instance of the relevant entity and an event args of type `LifecycleEvent`. The `LifecycleEvent` object provides various fields and methods to interact with the entity and its context. Here are the fields available in the `LifecycleEvent`:

- `isNew`: A boolean indicating whether the entity is new (being created).
- `fields`: A reference to the entity's fields, allowing you to access and modify field values.
- `id`: The ID of the entity.
- `originalId`: The original ID of the entity, which may differ during certain operations.
- `repository`: The repository associated with the entity.
- `metadata`: The metadata of the entity, providing information about its structure.
- `preventDefault()`: A method to prevent the default behavior associated with the event.
- `relations`: Access to repository relations for the entity, allowing you to work with related data.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use Entity Lifecycle Hooks to add custom logic to the `saving` event:

```ts
@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  saving: async (task, e) => {
    if (e.isNew) {
      task.createdAt = new Date(); // Set the creation date for new tasks.
    }
    task.lastUpdated = new Date(); // Update the last updated date.
  },
})
```

In this example, we've defined a `saving` event for the `Task` entity. When a task is being saved, the event handler is called. If the task is new (not yet saved), we set its `createdAt` field to the current date. In either case, we update the `lastUpdated` field with the current date.

Entity Lifecycle Hooks provide a powerful way to customize the behavior of your entities and ensure that specific actions or validations are performed at the right time in the entity's lifecycle. You can use these hooks to streamline your application's data management and enforce business rules.



# Entities - Migrations

# Migrations

Managing database schemas is crucial in web development. Traditional migration approaches introduce complexity and risks. Remult, designed for data-driven web apps with TypeScript, offers a simpler method.

## You Don't Necessarily Need Migrations

Migration files are standard but can complicate database schema management. They're prone to errors, potentially leading to conflicts or downtime. Remult proposes a streamlined alternative: automatic schema synchronization. This approach simplifies schema management by ensuring your database schema aligns with your application code without the manual overhead of traditional migrations.

### Embracing Schema Synchronization with Remult

Remult offers an alternative: automatic schema synchronization. **By default, Remult checks for and synchronizes your database schema with the entity types** provided in the `RemultServerOptions.entities` property when the server loads. This feature automatically adds any missing tables or columns, significantly simplifying schema management.

::: tip No Data Loss with Remult's Safe Schema Updates
**Remult's schema synchronization** ensures **safe and automatic updates** to your database schema. By only adding new tables or columns without altering existing ones, Remult prevents data loss. This design offers a secure way to evolve your application's database schema.
:::

#### Disabling Automatic Schema Synchronization

For manual control, Remult allows disabling automatic schema synchronization:

```typescript
const api = remultExpress({
  entities: [], // Your entities here
  ensureSchema: false, // Disables automatic schema synchronization, Default: true
})
```

#### Manually Triggering Schema Synchronization

In certain scenarios, you might want to manually trigger the `ensureSchema` function to ensure that your database schema is up-to-date with your entity definitions. Here's how you can do it:

```ts
remult.dataProvider.ensureSchema!(entities.map((x) => remult.repo(x).metadata))
```

## Quick Start: Introducing Migrations to Your Application

Introducing migrations to your Remult application involves a few straightforward steps. The goal is to ensure that your migrations and API share the same data provider and entity definitions. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. Refactor Your Configuration

Start by refactoring the `dataProvider` and `entities` definitions from the `api.ts` file to a new file named `src/server/config.ts`. This allows you to use the same configurations for both your API and migrations.

In your `src/server/config.ts` file, define your entities and data provider as follows:

```ts
import { createPostgresDataProvider } from 'remult/postgres'
import { Task } from '../shared/task'

export const entities = [Task /* ...other entities */]
export const dataProvider = createPostgresDataProvider({
  connectionString: 'your connection string',
})
```

:::tip Using environment variables
In most cases, the connection string for your database will not be hard-coded but stored in an environment variable for security and flexibility. A common practice is to use a `.env` file to store environment variables in development and load them using the `dotenv` npm package. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Install the `dotenv` package:

   ```sh
   npm install dotenv
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your database connection string:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_connection_string
   ```

3. At the beginning of your `src/server/config.ts` file, load the environment variables:

   ```ts
   import { config } from 'dotenv'
   config()
   ```

4. Access the connection string using `process.env`:

   ```ts
   export const dataProvider = createPostgresDataProvider({
     connectionString: process.env['DATABASE_URL'],
   })
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your application securely and flexibly manages the database connection string.

:::

### 2. Adjust the API Configuration

Next, adjust your `api.ts` file to use the configurations from the `config.ts` file, and disable the `ensureSchema` migrations:

```ts
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import { dataProvider, entities } from './config'

export const api = remultExpress({
  entities,
  dataProvider,
  ensureSchema: false,
})
```

### 3. Generate the migration

::: tip Prettier
The migration generator uses `prettier` to format the generated code for better readability and consistency. If you don't already have `prettier` installed in your project, we recommend installing it as a development dependency using the following command:

```sh
npm i -D prettier
```

:::

To enable automatic generation of migration scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Migrations Folder:** In your `src/server` directory, create a new folder named `migrations`. This folder will hold all your migration scripts.

2. **Create the Migration Generator File:** Inside the `migrations` folder, create a file named `generate-migrations.ts`. This file will contain the script that generates migration scripts based on changes in your entities.
   Here's the revised section:

3. **Populate the Generator File:** Add the following code to `generate-migrations.ts`:

   ```ts
   import { generateMigrations } from 'remult/migrations'
   import { dataProvider, entities } from '../config'

   generateMigrations({
     dataProvider, // The data provider for your database
     entities, // Entity classes to include in the migration
     endConnection: true, // Close the database connection after generating migrations (useful for standalone scripts)
   })
   ```

   This script generates migration scripts based on changes in your entities. If you're calling this method on a server where the database connection should remain open, omit the `endConnection` parameter or set it to `false`.

4. **Generate Migrations:** To generate the migration scripts, run the `generate-migrations.ts` script using the following command:

   ```sh
   npx tsx src/server/migrations/generate-migrations.ts
   ```

   This command will create two important files:

   1. **`migrations-snapshot.json`**: This file stores the last known state of your entities. It helps the migration generator understand what changes have been made since the last migration was generated.
   2. **`migrations.ts`**: This file contains the actual migration scripts that need to be run to update your database schema. The structure of this file is as follows:

      ```ts
      import type { Migrations } from 'remult/migrations'

      export const migrations: Migrations = {
        0: async ({ sql }) => {
          await sql(`--sql
            CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS public;
            CREATE TABLE "tasks" (
              "id" VARCHAR DEFAULT '' NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
              "title" VARCHAR DEFAULT '' NOT NULL
            )`)
        },
      }
      ```

      Each migration script is associated with a unique identifier (in this case, `0`) and contains the SQL commands necessary to update the database schema.

      By running this script whenever you make changes to your entities, you can automatically generate the necessary migration scripts to keep your database schema in sync with your application's data model.

      It's important to note that each migration can include any code that the developer wishes to include, not just SQL statements. The `sql` parameter is provided to facilitate running SQL commands, but you can also include other logic or code as needed. Additionally, developers are encouraged to add their own custom migrations to address specific requirements or changes that may not be covered by automatically generated migrations. This flexibility allows for a more tailored approach to managing database schema changes.

### 4. Run the Migrations

To apply the migrations to your database, you'll need to create a script that executes them.

#### Setting Up the Migration Script

1. **Create the Migration Script:** In the `src/server/migrations` folder, add a file named `migrate.ts`.

2. **Populate the Script:** Add the following code to `migrate.ts`:

   ```ts
   import { migrate } from 'remult/migrations'
   import { dataProvider } from '../config'
   import { migrations } from './migrations'

   migrate({
     dataProvider,
     migrations,
     endConnection: true, // Close the database connection after applying migrations
   })
   ```

   This script sets up the migration process. The `migrate` function checks the last migration executed on the database and runs all subsequent migrations based on their index in the `migrations` file. The entire call to `migrate` is executed in a transaction, ensuring that either all required migration steps are executed or none at all, maintaining the integrity of your database schema.

   ::: warning Warning: Database Transaction Support for Structural Changes
   It's important to note that some databases, like MySQL, do not support rolling back structural changes as part of a transaction. This means that if you make changes to the database schema (such as adding or dropping tables or columns) and something goes wrong, those changes might not be automatically rolled back. Developers need to be aware of this limitation and plan their migrations accordingly to avoid leaving the database in an inconsistent state.

   Always consult your database's documentation to understand the specifics of transaction support and plan your migrations accordingly.
   :::

3. **Execute the Script:** Run the migration script using the following command:

   ```sh
   npx tsx src/server/migrations/migrate.ts
   ```

## Integrating Migrations into Your Deployment Process

You have a couple of options for when and how to run your migrations:

- **As Part of the Build Step:** You can include the migration script as part of your build or deployment process. This way, if the migration fails, the deployment will also fail, preventing potential issues with an inconsistent database state.

- **During Application Initialization:** Alternatively, you can run the migrations when your application loads by using the `initApi` option in your `api.ts` file:

  ```ts
  // src/server/api.ts
  import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
  import { dataProvider, entities } from './config'
  import { migrate } from 'remult/migrations/migrate'
  import { migrations } from './migrations/migrations'
  import { remult } from 'remult'

  export const api = remultExpress({
    entities,
    dataProvider,
    initApi: async () => {
      await migrate({
        dataProvider: remult.dataProvider,
        migrations,
        endConnection: false, //it's the default :)
      })
    },
  })
  ```

  This approach ensures that the migrations are applied each time the API initializes. Note that the `migrate` and `generateMigrations` functions typically close the connection used by the `dataProvider` when they complete. In this code, we disable this behavior using the `endConnection: false` option, instructing the `migrate` function to keep the `dataProvider` connection open when it completes.

Choose the approach that best fits your application's deployment and initialization process.

### Migration Philosophy: Embracing Backward Compatibility

We believe in designing migrations with a backward compatibility mindset. This approach ensures that older versions of the code can operate smoothly with newer versions of the database. To achieve this, we recommend:

- Never dropping columns or tables.
- Instead of altering a column, adding a new column and copying the data to it as part of the migration process.

This philosophy minimizes disruptions and ensures a smoother transition during database schema updates.

# Entities - Offline Support

# Offline Support

In modern web applications, providing a seamless user experience often involves enabling offline functionality. This ensures that users can continue to interact with the application even without an active internet connection. Remult supports several offline databases that can be used to store data in the browser for offline scenarios, enhancing the application's resilience and usability.

## Using Local Database for Specific Calls

To utilize a local database for a specific call, you can pass the `dataProvider` as a second parameter to the `repo` function. This allows you to specify which database should be used for that particular operation.

```typescript
import { localDb } from './some-file.ts'

console.table(await repo(Task, localDb).find())
```

In this example, `localDb` is used as the data provider for the `Task` repository, enabling data fetching from the local database.

## JSON in LocalStorage / SessionStorage

For simple data storage needs, you can use JSON data providers that leverage the browser's `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.

```typescript
import { JsonDataProvider, Remult } from 'remult'
export const remultLocalStorage = new Remult(new JsonDataProvider(localStorage))
```

This approach is straightforward and suitable for small datasets that need to persist across sessions or page reloads.

## JSON Storage in IndexedDB

For more complex offline storage needs, such as larger datasets and structured queries, `IndexedDB` provides a robust solution. Using Remult’s `JsonEntityIndexedDbStorage`, you can store entities in `IndexedDB`, which is supported across all major browsers. This allows for efficient offline data management while offering support for larger volumes of data compared to `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.

```typescript
import { JsonDataProvider } from 'remult'
import { JsonEntityIndexedDbStorage } from 'remult'

// Initialize the JsonEntityIndexedDbStorage
const db = new JsonDataProvider(new JsonEntityIndexedDbStorage())

// Use the local IndexedDB to store and fetch tasks
console.table(await repo(Task, db).find())
```

In this example, `JsonEntityIndexedDbStorage` is used to persist the data to `IndexedDB`. This method is ideal for applications with large data sets or those requiring more complex interactions with the stored data in offline mode.

## JSON Storage in OPFS (Origin Private File System)

Origin Private File System (OPFS) is a modern browser feature supported by Chrome and Safari, allowing for more structured and efficient data storage in the frontend.

```typescript
import { JsonDataProvider } from 'remult'
import { JsonEntityOpfsStorage } from 'remult'

const localDb = new JsonDataProvider(new JsonEntityOpfsStorage())
```

Using OPFS with Remult's `JsonDataProvider` provides a robust solution for storing entities in the frontend, especially for applications requiring more complex data handling than what `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` can offer.

Certainly! Here's the adjusted section on `sql.js` with an enriched code sample:

## `sql.js`: A SQLite Implementation for the Frontend

For applications requiring advanced database functionality, [`sql.js`](https://sql.js.org/) provides a SQLite implementation that runs entirely in the frontend. This allows you to use SQL queries and transactions, offering a powerful and flexible data management solution for offline scenarios.

Before using `sql.js` in your project, you need to install the package and its TypeScript definitions. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install sql.js
npm install @types/sql.js --save-dev
```

After installing the necessary packages, you can use the following code sample in your project:

```typescript
import { SqlDatabase } from 'remult'
import { SqlJsDataProvider } from 'remult/remult-sql-js'
import initSqlJs from 'sql.js'

let sqlDb: Database
// Initialize the SqlJsDataProvider with a new database instance
const sqlJsDataProvider = new SqlJsDataProvider(
  initSqlJs({
    locateFile: (file) => `https://sql.js.org/dist/${file}`, // for complete offline support, change this to a url that is available offline
  }).then((x) => {
    // Load the database from localStorage if it exists
    const dbData = localStorage.getItem('sqljs-db')
    if (dbData) {
      const buffer = new Uint8Array(JSON.parse(dbData))
      return (sqlDb = new x.Database(buffer))
    }
    return (sqlDb = new x.Database())
  }),
)

// Set up an afterMutation hook to save the database to localStorage after any mutation
sqlJsDataProvider.afterMutation = async () => {
  const db = sqlDb
  const buffer = db.export()

  localStorage.setItem('sqljs-db', JSON.stringify([...buffer]))
}
const localDb = new SqlDatabase(sqlJsDataProvider)
```

This code sets up a SQLite database using `sql.js` in your Remult project, with support for saving to and loading from `localStorage`.

## Summary

Remult's support for various offline databases empowers developers to create web applications that provide a seamless user experience, even in offline scenarios. Whether using simple JSON storage in `localStorage` or more advanced solutions like OPFS or `sql.js`, Remult offers the flexibility to choose the right data storage solution for your application's needs. By leveraging these offline capabilities, you can ensure that your application remains functional and responsive, regardless of the user's connectivity status.



# Entities - Active Record & EntityBase

# Mutability and the Active Record Pattern

The Active Record pattern is a concept in software architecture, particularly useful when working with mutable objects whose state may change over time. This design pattern facilitates direct interaction with the database through the object representing a row of the data table. In this article, we'll delve into the fundamentals of the Active Record pattern, contrasting it with immutable patterns, and exploring its implementation and advantages in software development.

### Immutable vs. Mutable Patterns

In modern software development, handling data objects can generally be approached in two ways: immutable and mutable patterns.

**Immutable objects** do not change once they are created. Any modification on an immutable object results in a new object. For example, in the React framework, immutability is often preferred:

```typescript
// Immutable update
const updatePerson = { ...person, name: 'newName' }
```

However, libraries like MobX offer the flexibility to work with mutable objects while still providing the reactivity that React components need.

**Mutable objects**, on the other hand, allow for changes directly on the object itself:

```typescript
// Mutable update
person.name = 'newName'
```

Mutable patterns are especially prevalent in scenarios where the state of objects changes frequently, making them a staple in many programming environments outside of React.

### The Role of Active Record Pattern

The Active Record pattern embodies the concept of mutability by binding business logic to object data models. Typically, each model instance corresponds to a row in the database, with the class methods providing the functionality to create, read, update, and delete records.

### Warning: Mutable Objects in React

Using mutable objects with the Active Record pattern in React (without libraries like MobX) requires careful handling. React’s rendering cycle is built around the premise of immutability; it typically relies on immutable state management to trigger re-renders. When mutable objects change state outside the scope of React's `useState` or `useReducer`, React does not automatically know to re-render the affected components. This can lead to issues where the UI does not reflect the current application state.

These challenges can be mitigated by integrating state management tools that are designed to work well with mutable objects, such as MobX. MobX provides mechanisms to track changes in data and automatically re-render components when mutations occur. This aligns more naturally with the Active Record pattern within the context of React, ensuring that the UI stays in sync with the underlying data.

#### Using EntityBase and IdEntity

In practice, leveraging the Active Record pattern often involves inheriting from classes such as `EntityBase` or `IdEntity` (a variant of `EntityBase` with a UUID as the identifier). These base classes enrich models with methods that simplify manipulations of their attributes and their persistence in the database.

```typescript
@Entity('people')
export class Person extends IdEntity {
  @Fields.string()
  name = ''
}
```

**Explanation:**
The `Person` class represents individuals in the 'people' table and inherits from `IdEntity`. This inheritance means that there is no need to explicitly define an `id` field for this class, as `IdEntity` automatically includes a UUID field (`id`). Consequently, `Person` benefits from all the functionalities of `EntityBase`, which include tracking changes and handling CRUD operations, while also automatically gaining a UUID as the identifier.

### Mutable vs EntityBase (active-record)

**Traditional approach without Active Record:**

```typescript
// Updating a person's name the traditional way
await repo(Person).update(person, { name: 'newName' })
```

**Using Active Record with EntityBase:**

```typescript
// Active Record style
person.name = 'newName'
await person.save()
```

This pattern also simplifies other operations:

```typescript
// Deleting a record
await person.delete()

// Checking if the record is new
if (person.isNew()) {
  // Perform a specific action
}
```

#### Helper Members in EntityBase

EntityBase provides additional utility members like `_` and `$` to facilitate more complex interactions:

- **`_` (EntityRef Object):** Allows performing operations on a specific instance of an entity.

```typescript
await person._.reload()
```

- **`$` (FieldsRef):** Provides access to detailed information about each field in the current instance, such as their original and current values:

```typescript
// Logging changes in a field
console.log(
  `Name changed from "${person.$.name.originalValue}" to "${person.name}"`,
)
```

### Alternative Implementations

Even without direct inheritance from `EntityBase`, similar functionalities can be achieved using helper functions such as `getEntityRef`, which encapsulates an entity instance for manipulation and persistence:

```typescript
const ref = getEntityRef(person)
await ref.save()
```

### Conclusion

The Active Record pattern offers a straightforward and intuitive approach to interacting with database records through object-oriented models. It is particularly beneficial in environments where business logic needs to be tightly coupled with data manipulation, providing a clear and efficient way to handle data state changes. However, integrating the Active Record pattern with mutable objects in React can be challenging.



# Active Record & EntityBase - Entity Backend Methods

# Entity Instance Backend Methods

When leveraging the Active Record pattern, backend methods for entity instances offer a powerful way to integrate client-side behavior with server-side logic. These methods, when invoked, transport the entire entity's state from the client to the server and vice versa, even if the data has not yet been saved. This feature is particularly useful for executing entity-specific operations that require a round-trip to the server to maintain consistency and integrity.

## Overview of Entity Backend Methods

Entity backend methods enable all the fields of an entity, including unsaved values, to be sent to and from the server during the method's execution. This approach is essential for operations that rely on the most current state of an entity, whether or not the changes have been persisted to the database.

### Defining a Backend Method

To define a backend method, use the `@BackendMethod` decorator to annotate methods within an entity class. This decorator ensures that the method is executed on the server, taking advantage of server-side resources and permissions.

Here is an example demonstrating how to define and use a backend method in an entity class:

```typescript
@Entity('tasks', {
  allowApiCrud: true,
})
export class Task extends IdEntity {
  @Fields.string()
  title = ''

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false

  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  async toggleCompleted() {
    this.completed = !this.completed
    console.log({
      title: this.title,
      titleOriginalValue: this.$.title.originalValue,
    })
    await this.save()
  }
}
```

### Calling the Backend Method from the Frontend

Once the backend method is defined, it can be called from the client-side code. This process typically involves fetching an entity instance and then invoking the backend method as shown below:

```typescript
const task = await remult.repo(Task).findFirst()
await task.toggleCompleted()
```

### Security Considerations

::: danger
It's important to note that backend methods bypass certain API restrictions that might be set on the entity, such as `allowApiUpdate=false`. This means that even if an entity is configured not to allow updates through standard API operations, it can still be modified through backend methods if they are permitted by their `allowed` setting. Consequently, developers must explicitly handle security and validation within these methods to prevent unauthorized actions.

The principle here is that if a user has permission to execute the `BackendMethod`, then all operations within that method are considered authorized. It is up to the developer to implement any necessary restrictions within the method itself.
:::



# Active Record & EntityBase - Mutable Controllers

# Introduction to Mutable Controllers and Backend Methods

In web development architectures, mutable controllers offer a convenient way to manage state and facilitate interactions between the client (frontend) and the server (backend). These controllers are useful in scenarios where state needs to be maintained and manipulated across server calls, providing a streamlined approach to handling data.

## Overview of Controller Backend Methods

A Controller is a class designed to encapsulate business logic and data processing. When a backend method in a controller is called, it ensures that all field values are preserved and appropriately transferred between the frontend and backend, maintaining state throughout the process.

### Defining a Mutable Controller

The mutable controller is typically defined in a shared module, allowing both the frontend and backend to interact with it efficiently. Below is an example of how to define such a controller and a backend method within it.

### Explanation with Data Flow and Example Usage

This example demonstrates the use of a mutable controller, `UserSignInController`, to handle the sign-in process for users in a web application. Let's break down the key components of this example:

1. **Controller Definition**: The `UserSignInController` is a class annotated with `@Controller('UserSignInController')`, indicating that it serves as a controller for handling user sign-in operations.

2. **Data Flow**: When the `signInUser` backend method is called from the frontend, all the values of the controller fields (`email`, `password`, `rememberMe`) will be sent to the backend for processing. Once the method completes its execution, the updated values (if any) will be sent back to the frontend.

### Example Usage

Here's how you can use the `UserSignInController` on the frontend to initiate the sign-in process:

```typescript
const signInController = new UserSignInController()
signInController.email = 'user@example.com'
signInController.password = 'password123'
signInController.rememberMe = true // Optional: Set to true if the user wants to remain logged in

try {
  const user = await signInController.signInUser()
  console.log(`User signed in: ${user.email}`)
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Sign-in failed:', error.message)
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `UserSignInController` and set its `email`, `password`, and `rememberMe` fields with the appropriate values. We then call the `signInUser` method to initiate the sign-in process. If successful, we log a message indicating that the user has signed in. If an error occurs during the sign-in process, we catch the error and log a corresponding error message.

This usage demonstrates how to interact with the mutable controller to handle user sign-in operations seamlessly within a web application.

### Summary

Mutable controllers and backend methods provide a powerful mechanism for managing state and handling user interactions in web applications. By encapsulating business logic and data processing within controllers, developers can ensure consistent behavior and efficient data flow between the frontend and backend. With the ability to preserve and transfer field values during server calls, mutable controllers facilitate a smooth and responsive user experience, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of web applications.

# Framework - React

# React

## Create a React Project with Vite

To set up a new React project using Vite, run the following commands:

```sh
npm create vite@latest remult-react-project -- --template react-ts
cd remult-react-project
```

## Install Remult

Install the latest version of Remult:

```bash
npm install remult@latest
```

## Enable TypeScript Decorators in Vite

To enable the use of decorators in your React app, modify the `vite.config.ts` file by adding the following to the `defineConfig` section:

```ts{6-12}
// vite.config.ts

// ...
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  esbuild: {
    tsconfigRaw: {
      compilerOptions: {
        experimentalDecorators: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This configuration ensures that TypeScript decorators are enabled for the project.

## Proxy API Requests from Vite DevServer to the API Server

In development, your React app will be served from `http://localhost:5173`, while the API server will run on `http://localhost:3002`. To allow the React app to communicate with the API server during development, use Vite's [proxy](https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-proxy) feature.

Add the following proxy configuration to the `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts{6}
// vite.config.ts

//...
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: { proxy: { "/api": "http://localhost:3002" } },
  esbuild: {
    tsconfigRaw: {
      compilerOptions: {
        experimentalDecorators: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This setup proxies all requests starting with `/api` from `http://localhost:5173` to your API server running at `http://localhost:3002`.

## Configure a Server

Now that the app is set up, [Select an API Server](../server/)



# Framework - Angular

# Angular

## Create an Angular Project

To set up a new Angular project, use the Angular CLI:

```sh
ng new remult-angular
cd remult-angular
```

## Install Remult

Install the latest version of Remult in your Angular project:

```bash
npm install remult@latest
```

## Proxy API Requests from Angular DevServer to the API Server

In development, your Angular app will be served from `http://localhost:4200`, while the API server will run on `http://localhost:3002`. To allow the Angular app to communicate with the API server during development, you can use Angular's [proxy](https://angular.io/guide/build#proxying-to-a-backend-server) feature.

1. Create a file named `proxy.conf.json` in the root folder of your project with the following content:

```json
// proxy.conf.json

{
  "/api": {
    "target": "http://localhost:3002",
    "secure": false
  }
}
```

This configuration redirects all API calls from the Angular dev server to the API server running at `http://localhost:3002`.

## Adjust the `package.json`

Modify the `package.json` to use the newly created proxy configuration when serving the Angular app:

```json
// package.json

"dev": "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json --open",
```

Running the `dev` script will start the Angular dev server with the proxy configuration enabled.

## Configure a Server

Now that the app is set up, [Select an API Server](../server/)



# Framework - Vue

```bash
npm install remult@latest
```

## Enable TypeScript Decorators in Vite

To enable the use of decorators in your React app, modify the `vite.config.ts` file by adding the following to the `defineConfig` section:

```ts{6-12}
// vite.config.ts

// ...
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  esbuild: {
    tsconfigRaw: {
      compilerOptions: {
        experimentalDecorators: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This configuration ensures that TypeScript decorators are enabled for the project.

## Proxy API Requests from Vite DevServer to the API Server

In development, your React app will be served from `http://localhost:5173`, while the API server will run on `http://localhost:3002`. To allow the React app to communicate with the API server during development, use Vite's [proxy](https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-proxy) feature.

Add the following proxy configuration to the `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts{6}
// vite.config.ts

//...
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  server: { proxy: { "/api": "http://localhost:3002" } },
  esbuild: {
    tsconfigRaw: {
      compilerOptions: {
        experimentalDecorators: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This setup proxies all requests starting with `/api` from `http://localhost:5173` to your API server running at `http://localhost:3002`.

## Configure a Server

Now that the app is set up, [Select an API Server](../server/)



# Framework - Next.js

# Next.js

## Create a Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, run the following command:

```sh
npx -y create-next-app@latest remult-nextjs
```

When prompted, use these answers:

```sh
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? ... Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? ... No
```

Afterward, navigate into the newly created project folder:

```sh
cd remult-nextjs
```

## Install Remult

Install the latest version of Remult:

```bash
npm install remult
```

## Bootstrap Remult in the Backend

Remult is bootstrapped in a Next.js app by creating a [catch-all dynamic API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments). This route will pass API requests to an object created using the `remultNextApp` function.

1. **Create an API file**

   In the `src/` directory, create a file called `api.ts` with the following code to set up Remult:

   ```ts
   // src/api.ts

   import { remultNextApp } from 'remult/remult-next'

   export const api = remultNextApp({})
   ```

2. **Create the API Route**

   In the `src/app/api` directory, create a `[...remult]` subdirectory. Inside that directory, create a `route.ts` file with the following code:

   ```ts
   // src/app/api/[...remult]/route.ts

   import { api } from '../../../api'

   export const { POST, PUT, DELETE, GET } = api
   ```

This file serves as a catch-all route for the Next.js API, handling all API requests by routing them through Remult.

## Enable TypeScript Decorators

To enable the use of decorators in your Next.js app, modify the `tsconfig.json` file. Add the following entry under the `compilerOptions` section:

```json{7}
// tsconfig.json

{
  ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "experimentalDecorators": true // add this line
    ...
  }
}
```

## Run the App

To start the development server, open a terminal and run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Your Next.js app is now running with Remult integrated and listening for API requests.



# Framework - Sveltekit

# SvelteKit

## Create a SvelteKit Project

To create a new SvelteKit project, run the following command:

```sh
npx sv@latest create remult-sveltekit-todo
```

During the setup, answer the prompts as follows:

1. **Which Svelte app template?**: ... `minimal` Project
2. **Add type checking with TypeScript?** ... Yes, using `TypeScript` syntax
3. **Select additional options**: ... We didn't select anything for this tutorial. Feel free to adapt it to your needs.
4. **Which package manager?**: ... We took `npm`, if you perfer others, feel free.

Once the setup is complete, navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd remult-sveltekit-todo
```

## Install Required Packages and Remult

Install Remult and any necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install remult --save-dev
```

## Bootstrap Remult

To set up Remult in your SvelteKit project:

1. Create your remult `api`

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultSveltekit } from 'remult/remult-sveltekit'

export const api = remultSveltekit({})
```

:::

2. Create a remult `api route`

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/api/[...remult]/+server.ts]
import { api } from '../../../server/api'

export const { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE } = api
```

:::

## Final Tweaks

Remult uses TypeScript decorators to enhance classes into entities. To enable decorators in your SvelteKit project, modify the `tsconfig.json` file by adding the following to the `compilerOptions` section:

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true // [!code ++]
  }
}
```

## Run the App

To start the development server, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Your SvelteKit app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

Your SvelteKit project with Remult is now up and running.

# Extra

## Extra - Remult in other SvelteKit routes

To enable remult across all sveltekit route

::: code-group

```ts [src/hooks.server.ts]
import { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks'
import { api as handleRemult } from './server/api'

export const handle = sequence(
  // Manage your sequence of handlers here
  handleRemult,
)
```

:::

## Extra - Universal load & SSR

To Use remult in ssr `PageLoad` - this will leverage the `event`'s fetch to load data on the server
without reloading it on the frontend, and abiding to all api rules even when it runs on the server

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/+page.ts]
import { remult } from 'remult'
import type { PageLoad } from './$types'

export const load = (async (event) => {
  // Instruct remult to use the special svelte fetch
  // Like this univeral load will work in SSR & CSR
  remult.useFetch(event.fetch)
  return repo(Task).find()
}) satisfies PageLoad
```

:::

::: tip
You can add this in `+layout.ts` as well and all routes **under** will have the correct fetch out of the box.
:::

## Extra - Server load

If you return a remult entity from the `load` function of a `+page.server.ts`,
SvelteKit will complain and show this error:

```bash
Error: Data returned from `load` while rendering / is not serializable:
Cannot stringify arbitrary non-POJOs (data.tasks[0])
```

To fix this, you can use `repo(Entity).toJson()` in the server load function and `repo(Entity).fromJson()` in the .svelte file
to serialize and deserialize well the entity.

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/+page.server.ts]
import { repo } from 'remult'
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types'
import { Task } from '../demo/todo/Task'

export const load = (async () => {
  const tasks = repo(Task).toJson(await repo(Task).find())
  return {
    tasks,
  }
}) satisfies PageServerLoad
```

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import type { PageData } from "./$types";
  import { Task } from "../demo/todo/Task";
  import { repo } from "remult";

  let { data }: { data: PageData } = $props();

  let tasks = repo(Task).fromJson(data.tasks);
</script>
```

:::

---

#### Since `@sveltejs/kit@2.11.0`, there is a new feature: [Universal-hooks-transport](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/hooks#Universal-hooks-transport)

With this new feature, you can get rid of `repo(Entity).toJson()` and `repo(Entity).fromJson()` thanks to this file: `hooks.ts`.

::: code-group

```ts [src/hooks.ts]
import { repo, type ClassType } from 'remult'
import { Task } from './demo/todo/Task'
import type { Transport } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import { api } from './server/api'

// You can have:
// A/ a local entity array to work only these ones (like here)
//  or
// B/ import a global entity array that will be
//    shared between backend and frontend (not in ./server/api.ts)
const entities = [Task]

export const transport: Transport = {
  remultTransport: {
    encode: (value: any) => {
      for (let index = 0; index < entities.length; index++) {
        const element = entities[index] as ClassType<any>
        if (value instanceof element) {
          return {
            ...repo(element).toJson(value),
            entity_key: repo(element).metadata.key,
          }
        }
      }
    },
    decode: (value: any) => {
      for (let index = 0; index < entities.length; index++) {
        const element = entities[index] as ClassType<any>
        if (value.entity_key === repo(element).metadata.key) {
          return repo(element).fromJson(value)
        }
      }
    },
  },
}
```

```ts [src/routes/+page.server.ts]
import { repo } from 'remult'
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types'
import { Task } from '../demo/todo/Task'

export const load = (async () => {
  // const tasks = repo(Task).toJson(await repo(Task).find()) // [!code --]
  const tasks = await repo(Task).find()
  return {
    tasks,
  }
}) satisfies PageServerLoad
```

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import type { PageData } from "./$types";
  import { repo } from "remult";

  let { data }: { data: PageData } = $props();

  // let tasks = repo(Task).fromJson(data.tasks) // [!code --]
  let tasks = data.tasks
</script>
```

:::

## Extra - Svelte 5 & Reactivity

Remult is fully compatible with Svelte 5, Rune, and Reactivity.

To take full advantage of it, add this snippet:

::: code-group

```html [src/routes/+layout.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import { Remult } from 'remult'
  import { createSubscriber } from 'svelte/reactivity'

  // To be done once in the application.
  function initRemultSvelteReactivity() {
    Remult.entityRefInit = (x) => {
      let update = () => {}
      let s = createSubscriber((u) => {
        update = u
      })
      x.subscribe({
        reportObserved: () => s(),
        reportChanged: () => update(),
      })
    }
  }
  initRemultSvelteReactivity()
</script>
```

:::

Then you can use `$state`, `$derived` like any other places

::: code-group

```html [src/routes/+page.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  // Prepare a new task
  let editingTask = $state(repo(Task).create())

  // Check if the form has empty fields
  let formHasEmpty = $derived(!editingTask || editingTask.title.length === 0)

  // Clone the task to edit
  const editTask = async (task: Task) => {
    editingTask = repo(Task).getEntityRef(task).clone()
  }
</script>
```

# Framework - Nuxt

### Create a Nuxt Project

To create a new Nuxt project, run the following command:

```sh
npx nuxi init remult-nuxt-todo
cd remult-nuxt-todo
```

### Install Remult

Install Remult in your Nuxt project by running the following command:

```sh
npm install remult
```

### Enable TypeScript Decorators

To enable the use of TypeScript decorators in your Nuxt project, modify the `nuxt.config.ts` file as follows:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
// https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  compatibilityDate: '2024-04-03',
  devtools: { enabled: true },
  nitro: {
    esbuild: {
      options: {
        tsconfigRaw: {
          compilerOptions: {
            experimentalDecorators: true,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  vite: {
    esbuild: {
      tsconfigRaw: {
        compilerOptions: {
          experimentalDecorators: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Bootstrap Remult

1. **Create the API File**

   In the `server/api/` directory, create a dynamic API route that integrates Remult with Nuxt. The following code sets up the API and defines the entities to be used:

   ```ts [server/api/[...remult].ts]
   import { remultNuxt } from 'remult/remult-nuxt'
   import { Task } from '../../demo/todo/Task.js'

   export const api = remultNuxt({
     admin: true,
     entities: [Task],
   })

   export default defineEventHandler(api)
   ```

   This setup uses the Remult `Task` entity and registers the API routes dynamically for the entities within the app.

### Run the App

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The Nuxt app will now be running on the default address [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Setup Completed

Your Nuxt app with Remult is now set up and ready to go. You can now move on to defining your entities and building your task list app.



# Framework - SolidStart

# SolidStart

### Step 1: Create a New SolidStart Project

Run the following command to initialize a new SolidStart project:

```sh
npm init solid@latest remult-solid-start
```

Answer the prompts as follows:

```sh
o  Is this a Solid-Start project?   Yes
o  Which template would you like to use?   basic
o  Use TypeScript?   Yes
```

Once completed, navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd remult-solid-start
```

### Step 2: Install Remult

To install the Remult package, run:

```sh
npm i remult
```

### Step 3: Bootstrap Remult in the Backend

Remult is integrated into `SolidStart` using a [catch-all dynamic API route](https://start.solidjs.com/core-concepts/routing#catch-all-routes), which passes API requests to a handler created using the `remultSolidStart` function.

1. **Create the Remult API Configuration File**

   In the `src` directory, create a file named `api.ts` with the following code:

   ```ts
   // src/api.ts

   import { remultSolidStart } from 'remult/remult-solid-start'

   export const api = remultSolidStart({})
   ```

2. **Set Up the Catch-All API Route**

   In the `src/routes/api/` directory, create a file named `[...remult].ts` with the following code:

   ```ts
   // src/routes/api/[...remult].ts

   import { api } from '../../api.js'

   export const { POST, PUT, DELETE, GET } = api
   ```

### Step 4: Enable TypeScript Decorators

1. **Install Babel Plugins for Decorators**:

   ```sh
   npm i -D @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators @babel/plugin-transform-class-properties
   ```

2. **Configure Babel Plugins in SolidStart**:

   Add the following configuration to the `app.config.ts` file to enable TypeScript decorators:

   ```ts{6-14}
   // app.config.ts

   import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config"

   export default defineConfig({
     //@ts-ignore
     solid: {
       babel: {
         plugins: [
           ["@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators", { version: "legacy" }],
           ["@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties"],
         ],
       },
     },
   })
   ```

### Setup Complete

Your SolidStart project is now set up with Remult and ready to run. You can now proceed to the next steps of building your application.

# Express

### Install Required Packages

To set up your Express server with Remult, run the following commands to install the necessary packages:

```sh
npm install express remult
npm install --save-dev @types/express tsx
```

### Bootstrap Remult in the Backend

Remult is integrated into your backend as an `Express middleware`.

1. **Create the API File**

   Create a new `api.ts` file in the `src/server/` folder with the following code to set up the Remult middleware:

   ```ts
   // src/server/api.ts

   import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'

   export const api = remultExpress()
   ```

2. **Register the Middleware**

   Update the `index.ts` file in your `src/server/` folder to include the Remult middleware. Add the following lines:

   ```ts{4,7}
   // src/server/index.ts

   import express from "express"
   import { api } from "./api.js"

   const app = express()
   app.use(api)

   app.listen(3002, () => console.log("Server started"))
   ```

   ::: warning ESM Configuration
   In this tutorial, we are using ECMAScript modules (`esm`) for the Node.js server. This means that when importing files, you must include the `.js` suffix (as shown in the `import { api } from "./api.js"` statement).

   Additionally, make sure to set `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file.
   :::

#### Create the Server's TypeScript Configuration

In the root folder, create a TypeScript configuration file named `tsconfig.server.json` to manage the server's settings:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "module": "nodenext"
  },
  "include": ["src/server/**/*", "src/shared/**/*"]
}
```

This configuration enables TypeScript decorators, ensures compatibility with ECMAScript modules, and specifies the file paths for the server and shared code.

#### Create an `npm` Script to Start the API Server

To simplify the development process, add a new script in your `package.json` file to start the Express server in development mode:

```json
// package.json

"dev-node": "tsx watch --env-file=.env --tsconfig tsconfig.server.json src/server"
```

- `tsx`: A TypeScript Node.js execution environment that watches for file changes and automatically restarts the server on each save.
- `--env-file=.env`: Ensures environment variables are loaded from the `.env` file.
- `--tsconfig tsconfig.server.json`: Specifies the TypeScript configuration file for the server.

#### Start the Node Server

Finally, open a new terminal and run the following command to start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev-node
```

The server will now run on port 3002. `tsx` will watch for any file changes, automatically restarting the server whenever updates are made.

Your Nest.js app with Remult is now up and running on port `3002`.



# Stacks - Database

<script setup>
  import Icon from '../../../components/Icon.vue'
</script>

# Choose a Database

By default, if no database provider is specified, Remult will use a simple JSON file-based database. This will store your data in JSON files located in the `db` folder at the root of your project.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr)); gap: 5rem; margin-top: 2rem">

# Database - Json files

## JSON Files

You can store data in JSON files using Remult. Here's how to configure your server:

### Step 1: Configure the `dataProvider`

In your `index.ts` (or server file), configure the `dataProvider` to use JSON files as the storage mechanism:

```ts{5-6,12-14}
// index.ts

import express from "express"
import { remultExpress } from "remult/remult-express"
import { JsonDataProvider } from "remult"
import { JsonEntityFileStorage } from "remult/server"

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: async () =>
      new JsonDataProvider(new JsonEntityFileStorage("./db")) // Data will be stored in the 'db' folder
  })
)
```

### Explanation:

- **`JsonDataProvider`**: This is the data provider that will store your data in JSON format.
- **`JsonEntityFileStorage`**: Specifies the directory where the JSON files will be stored (in this case, `./db`).
- **`"./db"`**: The path where JSON files for entities will be created. Ensure the folder exists or it will be created automatically.

This configuration allows you to store and manage your application data in JSON files, ideal for small projects or quick setups.



# Database - PostgreSQL

# PostgreSQL

To set up PostgreSQL as the database provider for your Remult application, you'll need to configure the `dataProvider` property in the `api.ts` file.

### Step 1: Install the `node-postgres` package

Run the following command to install the necessary PostgreSQL client for Node.js:

```sh
npm i pg
```

### Step 2: Set the `dataProvider` Property

In the `api.ts` file, configure the `dataProvider` property to connect to your PostgreSQL database:

```ts{3,7,11-15}
import express from "express"
import { remultExpress } from "remult/remult-express"
import { createPostgresDataProvider } from "remult/postgres"

const app = express()

const connectionString = "postgres://user:password@host:5432/database"

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: createPostgresDataProvider({
      connectionString, // default: process.env["DATABASE_URL"]
      // configuration: {} // optional: a `pg.PoolConfig` object or "heroku"
    })
  })
)
```

### Alternative: Use an Existing PostgreSQL Connection

If you already have a PostgreSQL connection set up, you can pass it directly to Remult:

```ts
import { Pool } from 'pg'
import { SqlDatabase } from 'remult'
import { PostgresDataProvider } from 'remult/postgres'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'

const pg = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'your-connection-string-here',
})

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: new SqlDatabase(new PostgresDataProvider(pg)),
  }),
)
```

In this example, the `pg.Pool` is used to create the PostgreSQL connection, and `SqlDatabase` is used to interface with the `PostgresDataProvider`.



# Database - MySQL

# MySQL

### Step 1: Install `knex` and `mysql2`

Run the following command to install the required packages:

```sh
npm i knex mysql2
```

### Step 2: Set the `dataProvider` Property

In your `api.ts` file, configure the `dataProvider` to connect to your MySQL database using `Knex`:

```ts{3,9-18}
import express from "express"
import { remultExpress } from "remult/remult-express"
import { createKnexDataProvider } from "remult/remult-knex"

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: createKnexDataProvider({
      client: "mysql2", // Specify the MySQL client
      connection: {
        user: "your_database_user",
        password: "your_database_password",
        host: "127.0.0.1",
        database: "test",
      },
    }),
  })
)
```

### Alternative: Use an Existing Knex Provider

If you're already using a `knex` instance in your project, you can pass it directly to Remult:

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { KnexDataProvider } from 'remult/remult-knex'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import knex from 'knex'

const knexDb = knex({
  client: 'mysql2',
  connection: {
    user: 'your_database_user',
    password: 'your_database_password',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    database: 'test',
  },
})

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: new KnexDataProvider(knexDb), // Use the existing knex instance
  }),
)
```



# Database - MongoDB

## MongoDB

To use MongoDB as the database provider for your Remult application, follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Install MongoDB Driver

Run the following command to install the `mongodb` package:

```sh
npm i mongodb
```

### Step 2: Set the `dataProvider` Property

In your `api.ts` or server file, configure the `dataProvider` to connect to your MongoDB database:

```ts{3-4,10-14}
import express from "express"
import { remultExpress } from "remult/remult-express"
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb"
import { MongoDataProvider } from "remult/remult-mongo"

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: async () => {
      const client = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/local")
      await client.connect()
      return new MongoDataProvider(client.db("test"), client)
    }
  })
)
```

This setup connects to a MongoDB instance running on `localhost` and uses the `test` database. The `MongoDataProvider` manages the connection, allowing Remult to interact with MongoDB seamlessly.



# Database - SQLite3

Here’s the polished version of the **sqlite3** setup:

### SQLite3 Setup

This version of **SQLite3** works well even on platforms like StackBlitz.

### Step 1: Install SQLite3

Run the following command to install the `sqlite3` package:

```sh
npm i sqlite3
```

### Step 2: Configure the `dataProvider`

In your `api.ts` or server file, configure the `dataProvider` to connect to the SQLite database using **sqlite3**:

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import { SqlDatabase } from 'remult'
import sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'
import { Sqlite3DataProvider } from 'remult/remult-sqlite3'

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: new SqlDatabase(
      new Sqlite3DataProvider(new sqlite3.Database('./mydb.sqlite')),
    ),
  }),
)
```

This configuration connects to an SQLite database stored in the `mydb.sqlite` file. The `Sqlite3DataProvider` is wrapped inside the `SqlDatabase` class, enabling Remult to work with SQLite databases smoothly across different environments, including StackBlitz.



# Database - Better SQLite3

Here’s the polished version of the **Better-sqlite3** setup:

### Better-sqlite3

To use **Better-sqlite3** as the database provider for your Remult application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Better-sqlite3

Run the following command to install the `better-sqlite3` package:

```sh
npm i better-sqlite3
```

### Step 2: Configure the `dataProvider`

In your `api.ts` or server file, configure the `dataProvider` to connect to the SQLite database using **Better-sqlite3**:

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import { SqlDatabase } from 'remult'
import Database from 'better-sqlite3'
import { BetterSqlite3DataProvider } from 'remult/remult-better-sqlite3'

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: new SqlDatabase(
      new BetterSqlite3DataProvider(new Database('./mydb.sqlite')),
    ),
  }),
)
```

This setup connects to an SQLite database stored in the `mydb.sqlite` file. The `BetterSqlite3DataProvider` is wrapped inside the `SqlDatabase` class to allow Remult to interact with SQLite efficiently.



# Database - MSSQL

# Microsoft SQL Server

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Install `knex` and `tedious` to enable Microsoft SQL Server integration.

```sh
npm i knex tedious
```

### Step 2: Configure the `dataProvider`

In your `index.ts` (or server file), configure the `dataProvider` to use Microsoft SQL Server with the following `knex` client configuration:

```ts{5,11-25}
// index.ts

import express from "express"
import { remultExpress } from "remult/remult-express"
import { createKnexDataProvider } from "remult/remult-knex"

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: createKnexDataProvider({
      // Knex client configuration for MSSQL
      client: "mssql",
      connection: {
        server: "127.0.0.1", // SQL Server address
        database: "test", // Your database name
        user: "your_database_user", // SQL Server user
        password: "your_database_password", // Password for the SQL Server user
        options: {
          enableArithAbort: true, // Required option for newer versions of MSSQL
          encrypt: false, // Set to true if using Azure
          instanceName: "sqlexpress", // Optional: Define the SQL Server instance name
        },
      },
    }),
  })
)
```

### Step 3: Use an Existing `knex` Provider (Optional)

If you have an existing `knex` instance, you can easily integrate it with Remult like this:

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { KnexDataProvider } from 'remult/remult-knex'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import knex from 'knex'

const knexDb = knex({
  client: 'mssql', // Specify MSSQL as the client
  connection: {
    // Add your MSSQL connection details here
    server: '127.0.0.1',
    user: 'your_database_user',
    password: 'your_database_password',
    database: 'test',
  },
})

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: new KnexDataProvider(knexDb), // Use your existing knex instance
  }),
)
```

### Explanation:

- **`tedious`**: The underlying driver used by `knex` to connect to SQL Server.
- **`client: "mssql"`**: Specifies that we are using Microsoft SQL Server.
- **`createKnexDataProvider`**: Allows you to use `knex` to connect to SQL Server as the data provider for Remult.
- **`options`**: The additional configuration for SQL Server, including `enableArithAbort` and `encrypt`.

This setup lets you easily connect Remult to Microsoft SQL Server using `knex` for query building and `tedious` as the driver.



# Database - Bun SQLite

### Bun:SQLite

### Step 1: Configure the `dataProvider`

In your `api.ts` or server file, configure the `dataProvider` to use `bun:sqlite` as follows:

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import { SqlDatabase } from 'remult'
import { Database } from 'bun:sqlite'
import { BunSqliteDataProvider } from 'remult/remult-bun-sqlite'

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: new SqlDatabase(
      new BunSqliteDataProvider(new Database('./mydb.sqlite')),
    ),
  }),
)
```

### Explanation:

- **bun:sqlite**: This uses Bun's native SQLite database, `bun:sqlite`, to manage SQLite databases efficiently in a Bun-based environment.
- **BunSqliteDataProvider**: The `BunSqliteDataProvider` integrates the Bun SQLite database as a data provider for Remult.
- **SqlDatabase**: Wraps the `BunSqliteDataProvider` to make it compatible with Remult's SQL-based data provider system.

This setup allows you to use Bun's SQLite implementation as the database provider for your Remult application, leveraging Bun’s performance benefits with SQLite.



# Database - sqljs

### sql.js

### Step 1: Install sql.js

Run the following command to install the `sql.js` package:

```sh
npm i sql.js
```

### Step 2: Configure the `dataProvider`

In your `api.ts` or server file, configure the `dataProvider` to use `sql.js`:

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import { SqlDatabase } from 'remult'
import initSqlJs from 'sql.js'
import { SqlJsDataProvider } from 'remult/remult-sql-js'

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: new SqlDatabase(
      new SqlJsDataProvider(initSqlJs().then((SQL) => new SQL.Database())),
    ),
  }),
)
```

### Explanation:

- **sql.js**: This setup initializes an in-memory SQLite database using `sql.js`, a library that runs SQLite in the browser or in Node.js.
- **SqlJsDataProvider**: The `SqlJsDataProvider` is used to integrate the `sql.js` database as a Remult data provider.
- **Async Initialization**: The `initSqlJs()` function initializes the SQL.js engine and sets up the database instance.

This configuration allows you to use an in-memory SQLite database in your Remult application, powered by `sql.js`.



# Database - Turso

Here’s the polished version of the **Turso** setup:

### Turso Setup

### Step 1: Install Turso Client

Run the following command to install the `@libsql/client` package:

```sh
npm install @libsql/client
```

### Step 2: Configure the `dataProvider`

In your `api.ts` or server file, configure the `dataProvider` to connect to Turso using the Turso client:

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import { SqlDatabase } from 'remult'
import { createClient } from '@libsql/client'
import { TursoDataProvider } from 'remult/remult-turso'

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: new SqlDatabase(
      new TursoDataProvider(
        createClient({
          url: process.env.TURSO_DATABASE_URL,
          authToken: process.env.TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN,
        }),
      ),
    ),
  }),
)
```

### Explanation:

- **Turso Client**: This configuration uses the `@libsql/client` package to connect to the Turso database.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure you have `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` defined in your environment to securely pass the database connection URL and authentication token.
- **SqlDatabase**: The `TursoDataProvider` is wrapped with the `SqlDatabase` class, allowing seamless integration of Turso as a Remult data provider.

This setup allows you to use Turso as the backend database for your application.



# Database - DuckDb

## DuckDB

To use DuckDB as the database provider in your Remult-based application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install DuckDB

Run the following command to install `duckdb`:

```sh
npm i duckdb
```

### Step 2: Configure the `dataProvider`

In your `index.ts` (or server file), configure the `dataProvider` to use DuckDB:

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import { SqlDatabase } from 'remult' // [!code highlight]
import { Database } from 'duckdb' // [!code highlight]
import { DuckDBDataProvider } from 'remult/remult-duckdb' // [!code highlight]

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: new SqlDatabase( // [!code highlight]
      new DuckDBDataProvider(new Database(':memory:')), // [!code highlight]
    ), // [!code highlight]
  }),
)

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server is running on port 3000'))
```

### Explanation:

- **DuckDB setup**: The database is initialized with `new Database(':memory:')` to create an in-memory database. Replace `':memory:'` with a file path if you want to persist the database to disk.
- **SqlDatabase**: `SqlDatabase` is used to connect Remult with DuckDB through the `DuckDBDataProvider`.

This setup allows you to use DuckDB as your database provider in a Remult project.



# Database - Oracle

## Oracle Database

To use an Oracle database as the data provider for your Remult-based application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Install `knex` and `oracledb`:

```sh
npm i knex oracledb
```

### Step 2: Configure the `dataProvider`

In your `index.ts` (or server file), configure the `dataProvider` to use Oracle through `knex`:

```ts{5,11-19}
// index.ts

import express from "express"
import { remultExpress } from "remult/remult-express"
import { createKnexDataProvider } from "remult/remult-knex"

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: createKnexDataProvider({
      // Knex client configuration for Oracle
      client: "oracledb",
      connection: {
        user: "your_database_user",
        password: "your_database_password",
        connectString: "SERVER" // Specify your Oracle server connection string
      }
    })
  })
)

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server is running on port 3000"))
```

### Step 3: Using an Existing `knex` Provider

If you're already using a `knex` instance, you can easily plug it into Remult:

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { KnexDataProvider } from 'remult/remult-knex'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import knex from 'knex'

const knexDb = knex({
  client: 'oracledb',
  connection: {
    user: 'your_database_user',
    password: 'your_database_password',
    connectString: 'SERVER',
  },
})

const app = express()

app.use(
  remultExpress({
    dataProvider: new KnexDataProvider(knexDb), // Reuse your existing knex provider
  }),
)

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server is running on port 3000'))
```

### Explanation:

- **Knex configuration**: `client: "oracledb"` indicates you're using Oracle, and `connection` contains the necessary credentials and connection string.
- **Existing knex provider**: If you already have a `knex` instance, it can be reused directly with Remult.

This setup integrates Oracle into your Remult-based application.



# Server-side Code - Backend Methods

# Backend Methods

Backend methods run on the backend and are used to improve performance, execute server-only code (e.g., sending emails), or perform operations not accessible through the API.

## Static Backend Methods

Static backend methods represent the most straightforward type, transmitting their parameters to the backend and delivering their outcome to the frontend.

1. **Define the Backend Method:**

```typescript
import { BackendMethod, remult } from 'remult'
import { Task } from './Task'

export class TasksController {
  /**
   * Sets the completion status of all tasks.
   * @param {boolean} completed - The completion status to set for all tasks.
   */
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async setAll(completed: boolean) {
    const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task)

    for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
      await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
    }
  }
}
```

Each controller can house one or more backend methods, each serving distinct purposes tailored to your application's needs. In the provided example, the `TasksController` class contains a single backend method named `setAll`, responsible for setting the completion status of all tasks.

The method name, such as `setAll`, serves as the URL for the corresponding REST endpoint on the backend server. It's worth noting that you can configure a prefix for these endpoints using the `apiPrefix` option, providing flexibility in structuring your backend API routes.

The allowed: true parameter signifies that the backend method can be invoked by anyone. Alternatively, you can customize the authorization settings for finer control over who can access the method.

For instance, setting allow: Allow.authenticated restricts access to authenticated users only, ensuring that only logged-in users can utilize the method.

Similarly, specifying allow: 'admin' limits access to users with administrative privileges, granting access exclusively to administrators.

These options offer granular control over authorization, allowing you to tailor access permissions based on your application's specific requirements and security considerations.

2. **Register the Controller:**

```typescript
// Register TasksController in the controllers array of the remultExpress options
export const api = remultExpress({
  entities: [Task],
  controllers: [TasksController],
})
```

3. **Call from the Frontend:**

```typescript
await TasksController.setAll(true)
```

This example demonstrates how to define and use a static backend method, `setAll`, within the `TasksController` class. When called from the frontend, this method sets the completion status of all tasks to the specified value (`true` in this case). The method leverages Remult's `BackendMethod` decorator to handle the communication between the frontend and backend seamlessly.



# Server-side Code - Server-only Dependencies

# Backend only code

One of the main advantages of remult is that you write code once, and it runs both on the server and in the browser.

However, if you are using a library that only works on the server, the fact that the same code is bundled to the frontend can cause problems. For example, when you build an Angular project, you'll get `Module not found` errors.

This article will walk through such a scenario and how it can be solved.

For this example, our customer would like us to document each call to the `updatePriceOnBackend` method in a log file.

Our first instinct would be to add in the `products.controller.ts` file an import to `fs` (Node JS file system component) and write the following code:

```ts{1,10}
import * as fs from 'fs';
.....
@BackendMethod({allowed:true})
static async updatePriceOnBackend(priceToUpdate:number,remult?:Remult){
  let products = await remult.repo(Products).find();
  for (const p of products) {
      p.price.value += priceToUpdate;
      await p.save();
  }
  fs.appendFileSync('./logs/log.txt', new Date() + " " + remult.user.name + " update price\n");
}
```

::: danger Error
As soon as we do that, we'll get the following errors on the `ng-serve` terminal

```sh
ERROR in ./src/app/products/products.controller.ts
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'fs' in 'C:\try\test19\my-project\src\app\products'
i ｢wdm｣: Failed to compile.
```

:::

We get this error because the `fs` module on which we rely here is only relevant in the remult of a `Node JS` server and not in the context of the browser.

There are two ways to handle this:

## Solution 1 - exclude from bundler

::: tabs

== vite

### Exclude in `vite.config`

Instruct vite to exclude the `server-only` packages from the bundle

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {    // [!code ++]
    rollupOptions: {      // [!code ++]
      external: ['fs', 'nodemailer', 'node-fetch'], // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
  }, // [!code ++]
  optimizeDeps: {    // [!code ++]
    exclude: ['fs', 'nodemailer', 'node-fetch'], // [!code ++]
  }, // [!code ++]
})
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

== Webpack and Angular version <=16
Instruct `webpack` not to include the `fs` package in the `frontend` bundle by adding the following JSON to the main section of the project's `package.json` file.
_package.json_

```json
"browser": {
   "jsonwebtoken": false
}
```

- note that you'll need to restart the react/angular dev server.

== Angular 17

1. You'll need to either remove `types` entry in the `tsconfig.app.json` or add the types you need to that types array.
2. In `angular.json` you'll need to add an entry called `externalDependencies` to the `architect/build/options` key for your project

   ```json{21-23}
   // angular.json

   {
     "$schema": "./node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json",
     "version": 1,
     "newProjectRoot": "projects",
     "projects": {
       "remult-angular-todo": {
         "projectType": "application",
         "schematics": {},
         "root": "",
         "sourceRoot": "src",
         "prefix": "app",
         "architect": {
           "build": {
             "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:application",
             "options": {
               "outputPath": "dist/remult-angular-todo",
               "index": "src/index.html",
               "browser": "src/main.ts",
               "externalDependencies": [
                 "fs"
               ],
               "polyfills": [
                 "zone.js"
               ],
               //...

   ```

   :::

## Solution 2 - abstract the call

Abstract the call and separate it to backend only files and `inject` it only when we are running on the server.

**Step 1**, abstract the call - We'll remove the import to `fs,` and instead of calling specific `fs` methods, we'll define and call a method `writeToLog` that describes what we are trying to do:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```ts
import * as fs from 'fs'; // [!code --]

// We'll define an abstract `writeTiLog` function and use it in our code
static writeToLog:(textToWrite:string)=>void; // [!code ++]
.....
@BackendMethod({allowed:true})
static async updatePriceOnBackend(priceToUpdate:number,remult?:Remult){
  let products = await remult.repo(Products).find();
  for (const p of products) {
      p.price.value += priceToUpdate;
      await p.save();
  }
  fs.appendFileSync('./logs/log.txt', new Date() + " " + remult.user.name + " update price\n");  // [!code --]
  ProductsController.writeToLog(new Date() + " " + remult.user.name + " update price\n"); // [!code ++]
}

```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The method `writeToLog` that we've defined serves as a place holder which we'll assign to in the remult of the server.
It receives one parameter of type `string` and returns `void`.

**Step 2**, implement the method:
In the `/src/app/server` folder, we'll add a file called `log-writer.ts` with the following code:

```ts{3}
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { ProductsController } from '../products/products.controller';
ProductsController.writeToLog = what => fs.appendFileSync('./logs/log.txt', what);
```

Here we set the implementation of the `writeToLog` method with the actual call to the `fs` module.
This file is intended to only run on the server, so it'll not present us with any problem.

**Step 3**, load the `log-writer.ts` file:
In the `/src/app/server/server-init.ts` file, load the `log-writer.ts` file using an `import` statement

```ts{2}
import '../app.module';
import './log-writer'; //load the log-writer.ts file

import { Pool } from 'pg';
import { config } from 'dotenv';
import { PostgresDataProvider, PostgresSchemaBuilder } from '@remult/server-postgres';
import * as passwordHash from 'password-hash';

```

That's it - it'll work now.
::: tip
If you're still getting an error - check that you have a `logs` folder on your project :)

:::

Access control is essential for ensuring that users can only access resources they are authorized to in web applications. This article explores the various layers of access control, focusing on a framework that provides a granular approach to securing your application.

## Entity-Level Authorization

Entity-level authorization governs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations at the entity level. Each entity can define permissions for these operations using the following options:

- `allowApiRead`: Controls read access.
- `allowApiInsert`: Controls insert access.
- `allowApiUpdate`: Controls update access.
- `allowApiDelete`: Controls delete access.

Each option can be set to a boolean, a string role, an array of string roles, or an arrow function:

```typescript
// Allows all CRUD operations
@Entity("tasks", { allowApiCrud: true })

// Only users with the 'admin' role can update
@Entity("tasks", { allowApiUpdate: 'admin' })

// Only users with 'admin' or 'manager' roles can delete
@Entity("tasks", { allowApiDelete: ['admin', 'manager'] })

// Only the user 'Jane' can read
@Entity("tasks", { allowApiRead: () => remult.user?.name == 'Jane' })

// Only authenticated users can perform CRUD operations
@Entity("tasks", { allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated })
```

## Row-Level Authorization

Row-level authorization allows control over which rows a user can access or modify.

### Authorization on Specific Rows

The `allowApiUpdate`, `allowApiDelete`, and `allowApiInsert` options can also accept a function that receives the specific item as the first parameter, allowing row-level authorization:

```ts
// Users can only update tasks they own
@Entity<Task>("tasks", { allowApiUpdate: task => task.owner == remult.user?.id })
```

### Filtering Accessible Rows

To limit the rows a user has access to, use the `apiPrefilter` option:

```ts
@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  apiPrefilter: () => {
    // Admins can access all rows
    if (remult.isAllowed("admin")) return {}
    // Non-admins can only access rows where they are the owner
    return { owner: remult.user!.id }
  }
})
```

The `apiPrefilter` adds a filter to all CRUD API requests, ensuring that only authorized data is accessible through the API.

### Preprocessing Filters for API Requests

For more complex scenarios, you can use `apiPreprocessFilter` to dynamically modify the filter based on the specific request and additional filter information:

```ts
@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  apiPreprocessFilter: async (filter, {getPreciseValues}) => {
    // Ensure that users can only query tasks for specific customers
    const preciseValues = await getPreciseValues();
    if (!preciseValues.customerId) {
      throw new ForbiddenError("You must specify a valid customerId filter");
    }
    return filter;
  }
})
```

In this example, `apiPreprocessFilter` uses the `getPreciseValues` method to ensure that users must specify a valid `customerId` filter when querying tasks, allowing for more granular control over the data that is accessible through the API.

**Note:** The `preciseValues` object includes the actual values that are used in the filter. For example, in the code sample above, if the `customerId` filter specifies the values `'1'`, `'2'`, and `'3'`, then `preciseValues.customerId` will be an array containing these values. This allows you to check and enforce specific filter criteria in your preprocessing logic.

This added note explains the significance of the `preciseValues` property and how it includes the actual values used in the filter, providing an example for clarity.

### Warning: API Filters Do Not Affect Backend Queries

It's important to note that `apiPrefilter` and `apiPreprocessFilter` only apply to API requests. They do not affect backend queries, such as those executed through backend methods or non-Remult routes.

For instance, in a sign-in scenario, a backend method might need to check all user records to verify a user's existence without exposing all user data through the API. Once authenticated, the user should only have access to their own record for updates.

### Backend Filters for Consistent Access Control

To apply similar filtering logic to backend queries, you can use `backendPrefilter` and `backendPreprocessFilter`:

```ts
@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  backendPrefilter: () => {
    // Admins can access all rows
    if (remult.isAllowed("admin")) return {}
    // Non-admins can only access rows where they are the owner
    return { owner: remult.user!.id }
  },
  backendPreprocessFilter: async (filter, {getPreciseValues}) => {
    // Apply additional filtering logic for backend queries
    const preciseValues = await getPreciseValues(filter);
    if (!preciseValues.owner) {
      throw new ForbiddenError("You must specify a valid owner filter");
    }
    return filter;
  }
})
```

In this example, `backendPrefilter` and `backendPreprocessFilter` ensure that non-admin users can only access their own tasks in backend queries, providing consistent access control across both API and backend operations.

## Field-Level Authorization

Field-level authorization allows control over individual fields within an entity:

- `includeInApi`: Determines if the field is included in the API response.
- `allowApiUpdate`: Controls if a field can be updated. If false, any change to the field is ignored.

Examples:

```ts
// This field will not be included in the API response
@Fields.string({ includeInApi: false })
password = ""

// Only users with the 'admin' role can update this field
@Fields.boolean({ allowApiUpdate: "admin" })
admin = false

// Titles can only be updated by the task owner
@Fields.string<Task>({ allowApiUpdate: task => task.owner === remult.user!.id })
title=''

// This field can only be updated when creating a new entity
@Fields.string<Category>({ allowApiUpdate: (c) => getEntityRef(c).isNew() })
Description = ""
```

### Field Masking

To mask a field, combine a non-API field with a `serverExpression` that returns the masked value:

```ts
// This field is not included in the API response
@Fields.string({ includeInApi: false })
password = ""

// The field value is masked in the API response
@Fields.string<User>({
  serverExpression: () => "***",
  // Update the real password field when the masked field is changed
  saving: async (user, fieldRef, e) => {
    if (fieldRef.valueChanged()) {
      user.password = await User.hash(user.updatePassword)
    }
  },
})
updatePassword = ""
```

## BackendMethod Authorization

Backend methods use the `allowed` option to determine authorization:

```ts
// Only authenticated users can execute this method
@BackendMethod({ allowed: Allow.authenticated })
static async doSomething() {
  // something
}
```

The `allowed` option can receive a boolean, a string role, an array of role strings, or a function.

## Reusing Access Control Definitions in the Frontend

Access control definitions set in entities can be reused as a single source of truth in the frontend. This allows for consistent and centralized management of access control logic across your application. For example, in a React component, you can conditionally render UI elements based on the access control rules defined in the entity:

::: code-group

```tsx [React]
function UserComponent({ user }: { user: User }) {
  //...
  return (
    <tr>
      <td>{user.name}</td>
      {/* Only show the admin field if the user is allowed to see it */}
      {userRepo.fields.admin.includeInApi(user) && <td>{user.admin}</td>}
      {/* Only show the delete button if the user is allowed to delete the admin */}
      {userRepo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(user) && (
        <td>
          <button onClick={deleteUser}>Delete</button>
        </td>
      )}
    </tr>
  )
}
```

```html [Angular]
<tr>
  <td>{{user.name}}</td>
  <!-- Only show the admin field if the user is allowed to see it -->
  <td *ngIf="userRepo.fields.admin.includeInApi(user)">{{user.admin}}</td>
  <!-- Only show the delete button if the user is allowed to delete the admin-->
  <td *ngIf="userRepo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(user)">
    <button (click)="deleteUser(user)">Delete</button>
  </td>
</tr>
```

```vue [Vue]
<tr>
  <td>{{user.name}}</td>
  <!-- Only show the admin field if the user is allowed to see it -->
  <td v-if="userRepo.fields.admin.includeInApi(user)">{{user.admin}}</td>
  <!-- Only show the delete button if the user is allowed to delete the admin-->
  <td v-if="userRepo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(user)">
    <button @click="deleteUser(user)">Delete</button>
  </td>
</tr>
```

```svelte [Svelte]
<tr>
  <td>{{user.name}}</td>
  <!-- Only show the admin field if the user is allowed to see it -->
  {#if userRepo.fields.admin.includeInApi(user)}
  <td>{{user.admin}}</td>
  {/if}
  <!-- Only show the delete button if the user is allowed to delete the admin-->
  {#if userRepo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(user)}
  <td>
    <button (click)="deleteUser(user)">Delete</button>
  </td>
  {/if}
</tr>
```

# Escape Hatches - Custom/SQL Filters

# Leveraging Custom Filters for Enhanced Data Filtering

In modern web applications, efficiently filtering data is essential for providing a seamless user experience. Whether it's an e-commerce platform filtering products, a task management system sorting tasks, or any other application that requires data manipulation, the ability to apply complex filters is crucial. Custom filters offer a powerful solution, enabling developers to create reusable, declarative, and versatile filters that are executed on the backend and easily utilized from the frontend. This article delves into the concept of custom filters, illustrating their advantages and practical applications.

## The Advantages of Custom Filters

Custom filters provide several benefits that make them an attractive choice for handling data filtering in web applications:

1. **Declarative and Readable:** Custom filters allow you to express filtering logic in a clear, declarative manner. This improves code readability and maintainability, making it easier to understand and modify filtering criteria.

2. **Reusability:** By encapsulating filtering logic in custom filters, you can reuse the same filters across different parts of your application, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistency in filtering behavior.

3. **Backend Execution:** Custom filters are evaluated on the backend, leveraging the full capabilities of the underlying database or data provider. This enables more efficient data processing and allows you to perform complex operations that would be difficult or impossible to handle on the frontend.

4. **Composability:** Custom filters can be combined with other filters, both custom and standard, allowing you to build complex filtering logic in a modular and maintainable way.

5. **Flexibility with Data Providers:** Custom filters can be used with various data providers, including SQL databases, in-memory JSON arrays, and others. This flexibility allows you to apply custom filters in different contexts and with different data storage solutions.

6. **Enhanced Security:** When using custom filters with parameterized queries or data provider-specific filtering methods, you can mitigate the risk of injection attacks and ensure that user input is properly sanitized.

## Practical Example: Filtering Orders in an E-Commerce Application

Consider an e-commerce application where you need to filter orders based on their status and creation year. Without custom filters, the filtering logic might be repetitive and scattered throughout the codebase. By using custom filters, you can encapsulate this logic in a reusable component, simplifying the code and making it more maintainable.

In the following sections, we'll explore how to implement custom filters in this scenario, demonstrating their advantages and how they can be used to create more efficient and readable code.

## The Problem with Repetitive Filtering

Consider a scenario where you have an `Order` entity, and you frequently need to filter orders that are considered "active" based on their status and creation year. Without custom filters, your code might look something like this:

```ts
await repo(Order).find({
  where: {
    status: ['created', 'confirmed', 'pending', 'blocked', 'delayed'],
    createdAt: {
      $gte: new Date(year, 0, 1),
      $lt: new Date(year + 1, 0, 1),
    },
  },
})
```

This code is not only repetitive but also clutters your application, making it harder to maintain. Moreover, it generates lengthy REST API calls, such as:

```
/api/orders?status.in=%5B%22created%22%2C%22confirmed%22%2C%22pending%22%2C%22blocked%22%2C%22delayed%22%5D&createdAt.gte=2023-12-31T22%3A00%3A00.000Z&createdAt.lt=2024-12-31T22%3A00%3A00.000Z
```

## Introducing Custom Filters

Custom filters allow you to refactor your filtering logic into a reusable and declarative component. Here's how you can define a custom filter for active orders:

```ts
class Order {
  //...
  static activeOrdersFor = Filter.createCustom<Order, { year: number }>(
    async ({ year }) => {
      return {
        status: ['created', 'confirmed', 'pending', 'blocked', 'delayed'],
        createdAt: {
          $gte: new Date(year, 0, 1),
          $lt: new Date(year + 1, 0, 1),
        },
      }
    },
  )
}
```

- **First Generic Parameter (`Order`):** This parameter specifies the entity class that the filter is associated with. In this case, it's the `Order` class. This is important because it ensures that the filter criteria you define are compatible with the fields and types of the `Order` entity.

- **Second Generic Parameter (`{ year: number }`):** This parameter defines the type of the argument that the filter will receive when executed. In this example, the filter expects an object with a single property `year` of type `number`. This allows you to pass dynamic values to the filter when you use it in a query, making the filter more flexible and reusable.

- **Callback Function (`async ({ year }) => { ... }`):** This function is where you define the actual filtering criteria. It receives an argument matching the type specified in the second generic parameter. Inside the function, you return an object representing the filter conditions. In this case, the conditions are based on the `status` and `createdAt` fields of the `Order` entity.

Now, you can use this custom filter in your queries:

```ts
await repo(Order).find({
  where: Order.activeOrders({ year }),
})
```

This generates a much simpler REST API call:

```
/api/orders?%24custom%24activeOrders=%7B%22year%22%3A2024%7D
```

## Composability of Custom Filters

One of the key advantages of custom filters is their ability to be composed with other filters. This means you can combine custom filters with regular filters or even other custom filters to build complex filtering logic.

Let's take a closer look at the example you provided:

```ts
await repo(Order).find({
  where: {
    customerId: '123',
    $and: [Order.activeOrders({ year })],
  },
})
```

In this query, we're filtering orders based on two criteria:

1. The `customerId` should be "123".
2. The order should satisfy the conditions defined in the `activeOrders` custom filter for the specified year.

By using the `$and` operator, we're able to combine the custom filter with a regular filter. This demonstrates the composability of custom filters, allowing you to build more complex and nuanced filtering logic while maintaining readability and reusability.

### More on Composability

The power of composability doesn't stop there. You can also combine multiple custom filters to create even more specific filters. For example, suppose you have another custom filter called `highValueOrders` that filters orders based on their total value:

```ts
class Order {
  //...
  static highValueOrders = Filter.createCustom<Order>(() => {
    return {
      totalValue: { $gt: 1000 },
    }
  })
}
```

You can then combine this with the `activeOrders` filter to find high-value active orders for a specific year:

```ts
await repo(Order).find({
  where: {
    $and: [Order.activeOrders({ year }), Order.highValueOrders()],
  },
})
```

This ability to compose filters allows you to create modular and reusable filtering logic, which can significantly improve the maintainability and clarity of your code.

### Evaluating Custom Filters on the Backend

One of the significant advantages of custom filters is that they are evaluated on the backend. This allows you to perform complex data-related operations that would be inefficient or impossible to do solely on the frontend. For instance, you can leverage database queries or other server-side logic to build your filtering criteria.

Let's examine the example you provided:

```ts
static activeOrders = Filter.createCustom<
  Order,
  { year: number; customerCity: string }
>(async ({ year, customerCity }) => {
  const customers = await repo(Customer).find({
    where: { city: customerCity },
  })
  return {
    customerId: { $in: customers.map((c) => c.id) },
    status: ["created", "confirmed", "pending", "blocked", "delayed"],
    createdAt: {
      $gte: new Date(year, 0, 1),
      $lt: new Date(year + 1, 0, 1),
    },
  }
})
```

In this example, the custom filter `activeOrders` now takes an additional parameter `customerCity`. The filter performs a database query to fetch all customers from the specified city. It then uses the IDs of these customers to filter orders that belong to them. This is combined with the existing criteria of filtering orders based on their status and creation year.

::: tip Key Points

- **Backend Evaluation:** The filter is evaluated on the backend, where it has access to the database and can perform efficient queries. This offloads complex data processing from the frontend to the backend, where it can be handled more effectively.
- **Complex Filtering:** By leveraging backend capabilities, you can create filters that involve complex operations, such as fetching related data from other tables or entities (in this case, fetching customers based on their city).
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Notice the use of `async` in the filter definition. This allows you to perform asynchronous operations, such as database queries, within your custom filter.
  :::

## Leveraging Database Capabilities with Raw SQL in Custom Filters

Since custom filters are **evaluated on the backend**, you have the opportunity to harness the raw capabilities of the underlying database. This can be particularly useful when you need to perform complex operations that are more efficiently handled by the database itself. For instance, you can use raw SQL queries to improve the performance or functionality of your custom filters.

Let's modify the `activeOrders` custom filter to use a raw SQL query for filtering orders based on the customer's city:

```ts
static activeOrders = Filter.createCustom<
  Order,
  { year: number; customerCity: string }
>(async ({ year, customerCity }) => {
  return {
    status: ["created", "confirmed", "pending", "blocked", "delayed"],
    createdAt: {
      $gte: new Date(year, 0, 1),
      $lt: new Date(year + 1, 0, 1),
    },
    $and: [
      SqlDatabase.rawFilter(({param}) =>  // [!code highlight]
        `"customerId" in (select id from customers where city = ${param(customerCity)})` // [!code highlight]
      ), // [!code highlight]
    ],
  }
})
```

In this example, we've added a `$and` condition that uses `SqlDatabase.rawFilter` to include a raw SQL fragment in our filter. This SQL fragment selects the IDs of customers from the specified city and uses them to filter the orders.

This generates the following sql:

```sql
select "id", "status", "customerId", "createdAt"
from "orders"
where "status" in ($2, $3, $4, $5, $6)
and "createdAt" >= $7
and "createdAt" < $8
and ("customerId" in (select id from customers where city = $9))
Order By "id"
```

#### Important Notes

- **Parameterized Queries:** It's crucial to use parameterized queries (e.g., `builder.param(customerCity)`) when incorporating user-supplied values into your SQL queries. This helps prevent SQL injection attacks by ensuring that user input is properly escaped.
- **Performance Considerations:** Leveraging raw SQL can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for complex queries. However, it's important to ensure that your SQL queries are well-optimized to avoid potential performance issues.

#### Usage Example

Using the custom filter remains straightforward:

```ts
await repo(Order).find({
  where: Order.activeOrders({ year: 2024, customerCity: 'New York' }),
})
```

### Using `dbNamesOf` with Table Names and Aliases

The `dbNamesOf` utility function can be customized to include the table name in the SQL queries. This is particularly useful for ensuring consistency between your entity definitions and your raw SQL queries.

Here's an updated example of the `activeOrders` custom filter using `dbNamesOf` with table names and aliases:

```ts
static activeOrders = Filter.createCustom<
  Order,
  { year: number; customerCity: string }
>(async ({ year, customerCity }) => {
  const order = await dbNamesOf(Order, { // [!code highlight]
    tableName: true, // [!code highlight]
  })
  const customer = await dbNamesOf(Customer, { // [!code highlight]
    tableName: "c", // [!code highlight]
  }) // [!code highlight]

  return {
    status: ["created", "confirmed", "pending", "blocked", "delayed"],
    createdAt: {
      $gte: new Date(year, 0, 1),
      $lt: new Date(year + 1, 0, 1),
    },
    $and: [
      SqlDatabase.rawFilter(({param}) => // [!code highlight]
        `${order.customerId} in (select ${customer.id} from ${customer} as c // [!code highlight]
           where ${customer.city} = ${param(customerCity)})` // [!code highlight]
      ),
    ],
  }
})
```

In this example:

- The `Order` table is referenced with its full name.
- The `Customer` table is aliased as `"c"`, and this alias is used in the SQL query.

### Explanation of `tableName` and Aliases

- **`tableName: true`:** By setting `tableName: true`, you indicate that you want to include the table name when referring to fields, resulting in SQL expressions like `"customer"."id"`.
- **Aliases:** You can use aliases for table names, which is particularly useful in complex join scenarios. For example, setting `tableName: "c"` would use the alias `"c"` for the table name in the SQL query.

### Resulting SQL Query

Using the `activeOrders` custom filter with the enhancements mentioned above would generate the following SQL query:

```sql
select "id", "status", "customerId", "createdAt"
from "orders"
where "status" in ($2, $3, $4, $5, $6)
and "createdAt" >= $7
and "createdAt" < $8
and ("orders"."customerId" in (select "c"."id" from "customers" as c
           where c."city" = $9))
Order By "id"
```

In this SQL query, the `Customer` table is aliased as `"c"`, and this alias is used throughout the query to ensure consistency with the entity definitions and to handle complex join scenarios effectively.

### SQL-Based Custom Filters: Unleashing the Power of Composability

The greatest advantage of using SQL-based custom filters lies in their composability and the ability to handle complex situations. By breaking down filtering logic into smaller, atomic custom filters, developers can compose these filters to create more sophisticated and nuanced filtering criteria. This modular approach not only enhances the readability and maintainability of the code but also allows for greater flexibility in constructing complex queries.

For instance, consider a scenario where you need to filter orders based on multiple criteria, such as status, creation year, customer location, and order value. By creating separate custom filters for each of these criteria, you can easily combine them to form a comprehensive filtering solution. This composability ensures that your filtering logic can adapt to various requirements without becoming convoluted or difficult to manage.

Furthermore, the ability to handle complex situations is a significant advantage of SQL-based custom filters. By leveraging the raw power of SQL, you can perform advanced operations such as subqueries, joins, and aggregate functions directly within your filters. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for data analysis and manipulation, enabling you to tackle complex filtering scenarios with ease.

SQL is a language that is widely recognized and understood by AI technologies such as ChatGPT, Copilot and others. This makes it possible to generate highly optimized queries with ease. These AI technologies can assist in writing SQL queries, ensuring they are efficient and effective. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with complex data structures and large datasets, where writing optimal queries can be challenging. With the assistance of AI, developers can focus more on the logic of their applications, while the AI handles the intricacies of SQL query optimization.

In summary, the composability of SQL-based custom filters, coupled with their ability to handle complex situations, makes them an invaluable tool for developers seeking to create flexible, efficient, and powerful data filtering solutions in their web applications.

### Using Raw Filters with Different Data Providers

Custom filters with raw filters are not limited to SQL databases. You can also use raw filters with other data providers, such as Knex or an in-memory JSON data provider. This flexibility allows you to leverage the power of raw filters in various contexts, depending on your application's needs.

#### Knex Example

Knex is a popular SQL query builder for Node.js. You can use Knex with custom filters to define complex filtering logic directly using the Knex query builder syntax.

```typescript
static idBetween = Filter.createCustom<Task, {
  from: number,
  to: number
}>(
  ({ from, to }) => {
    return KnexDataProvider.rawFilter(({ knexQueryBuilder }) => {
      knexQueryBuilder.andWhereBetween('id', [from, to]);
    });
  }
);
```

In this example, the `idBetween` custom filter uses Knex to filter `Task` entities whose `id` falls between the specified `from` and `to` values.

#### JSON Example

For applications that use an in-memory JSON data provider, you can define custom filters that operate directly on the JSON data.

```typescript
static titleLengthFilter = Filter.createCustom<Task, { minLength: number }>(
  ({ minLength }) => {
    return ArrayEntityDataProvider.rawFilter((item) => {
      return item.title?.length > minLength;
    });
  }
);
```

In this example, the `titleLengthFilter` custom filter filters `Task` entities based on the length of their `title` property, ensuring that it exceeds the specified `minLength`.

## Conclusion

Custom filters represent a powerful tool in the arsenal of web developers, offering a flexible and efficient way to handle data filtering in web applications. By encapsulating filtering logic into reusable components, custom filters not only enhance code readability and maintainability but also enable the execution of complex filtering operations on the backend. This leads to improved performance and security, as well as the ability to compose intricate filtering criteria with ease.

The versatility of custom filters extends to their compatibility with various data providers, from SQL databases to in-memory JSON arrays, allowing developers to leverage the most suitable data handling mechanisms for their specific use cases. Moreover, the declarative nature of custom filters ensures that the filtering logic remains clear and concise, facilitating easier debugging and future modifications.

In conclusion, adopting custom filters in your web development projects can significantly streamline the process of data filtering, resulting in cleaner, more efficient, and more secure code. By embracing this approach, developers can focus on delivering a seamless user experience, confident in the knowledge that their data filtering logic is both robust and adaptable.



# Escape Hatches - Direct Database Access

# Accessing the Underlying Database in Remult

While Remult provides a powerful abstraction for working with databases, there might be scenarios where you need to access the underlying database directly. This could be for performing complex queries, optimizations, or other database-specific operations that are not covered by Remult's API.

:::warning
Directly executing custom SQL can be dangerous and prone to SQL injection attacks. Always use parameterized queries and the `param` method provided by Remult to safely include user input in your queries.
:::

## Accessing SQL Databases

For SQL-based databases, Remult provides the SqlDatabase class to interact directly with the database and allows you to run raw SQL queries directly. This is useful for executing complex queries that involve operations like GROUP BY, bulk updates, and other advanced SQL features.

### Basic SQL Query

```typescript
const sql = SqlDatabase.getDb()
const result = await sql.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM tasks')
console.log(result.rows[0].count)
```

This approach is straightforward but can lead to inconsistencies if the database schema changes.

#### the `dbNamesOf` function:

The `dbNamesOf` function dynamically retrieves the database table and column names based on your entity definitions, ensuring that your queries stay in sync with your data model. This enhances consistency, maintainability, and searchability in your code.

```typescript
const tasks = await dbNamesOf(Task)
const sql = SqlDatabase.getDb()
const result = await sql.execute(`SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM ${tasks}`)
console.log(result.rows[0].count)
```

##### Create index example

```typescript
const tasks = await dbNamesOf(Task)
const sql = SqlDatabase.getDb()
await sql.execute(`CREATE INDEX idx_task_title ON ${tasks}(${tasks.title});`)
```

### Using Bound Parameters

The `param` method safely incorporates user input into the query, reducing the risk of SQL injection by using parameterized queries.

```typescript
const priceToUpdate = 5
const products = await dbNamesOf(Product)
const sql = SqlDatabase.getDb()
let command = sql.createCommand()
await command.execute(
  `UPDATE ${products} SET ${products.price} = ${
    products.price
  } + ${command.param(priceToUpdate)}`,
)
```

When executed, this code will run the following SQL:

```sql
UPDATE products SET price = price + $1
Arguments: { '$1': 5 }
```

### Leveraging EntityFilter for SQL Databases

The `filterToRaw` function converts Remult's `EntityFilter` objects into SQL where clauses, enabling you to incorporate complex filtering logic defined in your models into custom SQL queries. This allows for reusability and integration with backend filters.

#### Benefits of filterToRaw

- **Reusability**: Allows you to reuse complex filters defined in your Remult models in custom SQL queries.
- **Integration**: Respects any **backendPrefilter** and **backendPreprocessFilter** applied to your entities, ensuring consistent access control and data manipulation rules.

```typescript
const order = await dbNamesOf(Order)
const sql = SqlDatabase.getDb()
const command = sql.createCommand()
const filterSql = await SqlDatabase.filterToRaw(
  Order,
  {
    status: ['created', 'confirmed', 'pending', 'blocked', 'delayed'],
    createdAt: {
      $gte: new Date(year, 0, 1),
      $lt: new Date(year + 1, 0, 1),
    },
  },
  command,
)
const result = await command.execute(
  `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ${order} WHERE ${filterSql}`,
)
console.log(result.rows[0].count)
```

Resulting SQL:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "orders"
WHERE "status" IN ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5) AND "createdAt" >= $6 AND "createdAt" < $7
```

Using `customFilter`:

```typescript
const order = await dbNamesOf(Order)
const sql = SqlDatabase.getDb()
const command = sql.createCommand()
const filterSql = await SqlDatabase.filterToRaw(
  Order,
  Order.activeOrders({ year, customerCity: 'London' }),
  command,
)
const result = await command.execute(
  `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ${order} WHERE ${filterSql}`,
)
console.log(result.rows[0].count)
```

Resulting SQL:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "orders"
WHERE "status" IN ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5) AND "createdAt" >= $6 AND "createdAt" < $7 AND ("orders"."customerId" IN (
      SELECT "customers"."id" FROM "customers"
             WHERE "customers"."city" = $8
        ))
```

## Accessing Other Databases

## Knex

```typescript
const tasks = await dbNamesOf(Task)
const knex = KnexDataProvider.getDb()
const result = await knex(tasks.$entityName).count()

console.log(result[0].count)
```

### Leveraging EntityFilter for Knex

```ts
const tasks = await dbNamesOf(Task)
const knex = KnexDataProvider.getDb()
const r = await knex(tasks.$entityName)
  .count()
  .where(await KnexDataProvider.filterToRaw(Task, { id: [1, 3] }))
console.log(r[0].count)
```

## MongoDB

```ts
const tasks = await dbNamesOf(Task)
const mongo = MongoDataProvider.getDb()
const r = await(await mongo.collection(tasks.$entityName)).countDocuments()
console.log(r)
```

### Leveraging EntityFilter for MongoDb

```ts
const tasks = await dbNamesOf(Task)
const mongo = MongoDataProvider.getDb()
const r = await(await mongo.collection(tasks.$entityName)).countDocuments(
  await MongoDataProvider.filterToRaw(Task, { id: [1, 2] }),
)
console.log(r)
```

## Native postgres

```ts
const tasks = await dbNamesOf(Task)
const sql = PostgresDataProvider.getDb()
const r = await sql.query(`select count(*) as c from ${tasks}`)
console.log(r.rows[0].c)
```

## Conclusion

Accessing the underlying database directly in Remult provides the flexibility to handle complex use cases that might not be covered by the ORM layer. However, it's important to use this capability judiciously and securely, especially when dealing with user input, to avoid potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection. By leveraging utilities like `dbNamesOf` and `filterToRaw



# Escape Hatches - Using Remult in Non-Remult Routes

# Using Remult in Non-Remult Routes

When using the CRUD api or [BackendMethods](./backendMethods.md), `remult` is automatically available. Still, there are many use cases where you may want to user remult in your own routes or other code without using `BackendMethods` but would still want to take advantage of `Remult` as an ORM and use it to check for user validity, etc...

If you tried to use the `remult` object, you may have got the error:

## Error: remult object was requested outside of a valid context, try running it within initApi or a remult request cycle <!-- I've placed this as header for search-->

Here's how you can use remult in this context, according to the server you're using:

::: tabs
== Express

### withRemult middleware

You can use remult as an express middleware for a specific route, using `api.withRemult`

```ts{1}
app.post('/api/customSetAll', api.withRemult, async (req, res) => {
  // ....
})
```

Or as an express middleware for multiple routes

```ts
app.use(api.withRemult) // [!code highlight]
app.post('/api/customSetAll', async (req, res) => {
  // ....
})
```

### withRemultAsync promise wrapper

Use the `api.withRemultAsync` method in promises

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'

const app = express();
...
const api = remultExpress({
  entities:[Task]
})
app.post('/api/customSetAll', async (req, res) => {
  // use remult in a specific piece of code // [!code highlight]
  await api.withRemultAsync(req, async ()=> { // [!code highlight]
    if (!remult.authenticated()) {
      res.sendStatus(403);
      return;
    }
    if (!remult.isAllowed("admin")) {
      res.sendStatus(403);
      return;
    }
    const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task);
    for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
      task.completed = req.body.completed;
      await taskRepo.save(task);
    }
    res.send();
  })
});
```

You can also use it without sending the request object, for non request related code

```ts{2}
setInterval(async () => {
  api.withRemultAsync(undefined, async () => {
    // ....
  })
}, 10000)
```

    })
  })
}
```

== Sveltekit

You can use the `withRemult` method in specific routes

```ts
// src/routes/api/test/+server.ts

import { json, type RequestHandler } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import { remult } from 'remult'
import { Task } from '../../../shared/Task'
import { _api } from '../[...remult]/+server'

export const GET: RequestHandler = async (event) => {
  return _api.withRemult(event, async () =>
    json({ result: await remult.repo(Task).count() }),
  )
}
```

You can also define the withRemult as a hook, to make remult available throughout the application

```ts
// src/hooks.server.ts
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks'
import { _api } from './routes/api/[...remult]/+server'

/**
 * Handle remult server side
 */
const handleRemult: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  return await _api.withRemult(event, async () => await resolve(event))
}

export const handle = sequence(
  // Handle remult server side
  handleRemult,
)
```

== SolidStart

You can use the `withRemult` method in specific routes

```ts
// src/routes/api/test.ts

import { remult } from 'remult'
import { Task } from '../../../shared/Task'
import { _api } from '../[...remult]/+server'

export function GET() {
  return api.withRemult(event, async () =>
    ({ result: await remult.repo(Task).count() }),
  )
}
```

You can also use the same method for any "use server" function
```ts
export function getCount(){
  return api.withRemult(event, async () =>
   ({ result: await remult.repo(Task).count() }),
  )
}
```

 */
const handleRemult: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  return await _api.withRemult(event, async () => await resolve(event))
}

export const handle = sequence(
  // Handle remult server side
  handleRemult,
)
```

# Escape Hatches - Avoiding Decorators

# Working without decorators

If you prefer to work without decorators, or use `remult` in a javascript project (without typescript) you can use the following:

## Entity

::: code-group

```ts [Typescript]
import { Entity, Fields, describeEntity } from 'remult'

export class Task {
  id!: string
  title = ''
  completed = false
}
describeEntity(
  Task,
  'tasks',
  {
    allowApiCrud: true,
  },
  {
    id: Fields.uuid(),
    title: Fields.string(),
    completed: Fields.boolean(),
  },
)
```

```js [Javascript]
import { Entity, Fields, describeEntity } from 'remult'

export class Task {
  id
  title = ''
  completed = false
}
describeEntity(
  Task,
  'tasks',
  {
    allowApiCrud: true,
  },
  {
    id: Fields.uuid(),
    title: Fields.string(),
    completed: Fields.boolean(),
  },
)
```

:::

This is the same entity that is detailed in the [Entities section of the tutorial](https://remult.dev/tutorials/react/entities.html)

## Static BackendMethod

```ts{12-14}
import { BackendMethod, describeBackendMethods, remult } from "remult";
import { Task } from "./Task";

export class TasksController {
  static async setAll(completed: boolean) {
    const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task);
    for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
      await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed });
    }
  }
}
describeBackendMethods(TasksController, {
  setAll: { allowed: "admin" }
})
```

This is the same backend method that is detailed in the [Backend methods of the tutorial](https://remult.dev/tutorials/react/backend-methods.html#refactor-from-front-end-to-back-end)



# Escape Hatches - Extensibility

# Extensibility

[Module Augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation) in TypeScript allows you to extend existing types with custom properties or methods. This enhances the functionality of third-party libraries like `remult` without altering their source code, enabling seamless integration of custom features while maintaining type safety.

In Remult, you can use TypeScript's module augmentation to enhance your application with custom features. Here are some examples:

1. **Add more fields to the User object:** Extend the `UserInfo` interface to include additional fields like `email` and `phone`.
2. **Add custom options/metadata to fields and entities:** Extend the `FieldOptions` or `EntityOptions` interfaces to include custom properties such as `placeholderText` or `helpText`.
3. **Add fields/methods to the `remult.context` object:** Extend the `RemultContext` interface to include additional properties or methods that can be accessed throughout your code.

## Setting Up the types.d.ts File for Custom Type Extensions

To set up the `types.d.ts` file for custom type extensions in Remult:

1. **Create a TypeScript Declaration File:** Add a file named `types.d.ts` in the `src` folder of your project. This file will be used to declare custom type extensions, such as additional user info fields.

   ```ts
   // src/types.d.ts
   export {}

   declare module 'remult' {
     interface UserInfo {
       phone: string // [!code highlight]
       email: string // [!code highlight]
     }
   }
   ```

   The `export {}` is required to indicate that this file is a module, as per the [Vue.js documentation on augmenting global properties](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/options-api.html#augmenting-global-properties).

2. **Include the Declaration File in tsconfig:** Make sure that the `types.d.ts` file is included in the `include` section of your `tsconfig.json` file. If you have a separate `tsconfig` for the server, ensure that it's also added there.

   ```json
   // tsconfig.server.json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       //...
     },
     "include": ["src/server/**/*", "src/shared/**/*", "src/types.d.ts"] // [!code highlight]
   }
   ```

3. **Utilize the Custom Fields in Your Code:** Once you've defined custom fields in the `types.d.ts` file and ensured they're included in your `tsconfig.json`, you can start using them throughout your application. For instance, if you've added `phone` and `email` to the `UserInfo` interface, you can access these properties in your code as follows:

   ```ts
   // Accessing custom user info fields
   console.log(remult.user.phone)
   console.log(remult.user.email)
   ```

   This enables you to seamlessly integrate the new fields into your application's logic and user interface.

## Enhancing Field and Entity Definitions with Custom Options

One of the key motivations for adding custom options to `FieldOptions` or `EntityOptions` is to maintain consistency and centralize the definition of entities and fields in your application. By keeping these definitions close to the entity or field, you ensure a single source of truth for your application's data model. This approach enhances maintainability and readability, as all relevant information and metadata about an entity or field are located in one place. Additionally, it allows for easier integration with UI components, as custom options like `placeholderText` can be directly accessed and used in your frontend code.

For adding custom options to `FieldOptions` or `EntityOptions`, such as `placeholderText`:

1. **Extend FieldOptions:** In your `types.d.ts` file, extend the `FieldOptions` interface to include your custom options. For example:

   ```ts
   declare module 'remult' {
     interface FieldOptions<entityType, valueType> {
       placeholderText?: string // [!code highlight]
     }
   }

   export {}
   ```

2. **Set Custom Option:** Specify the `placeholderText` in your entity field options:

   ```ts
   import { Entity, Fields } from 'remult'

   @Entity('tasks', { allowApiCrud: true })
   export class Task {
     @Fields.uuid()
     id!: string

     @Fields.string({
       placeholderText: 'Please enter a task title', // [!code highlight]
     })
     title = ''

     @Fields.boolean()
     completed = false
   }
   ```

3. **Use in UI:** Access the custom option in your UI components:

   ```html{2}
   <input
     placeholder="{taskRepo.fields.title.options.placeholderText}"
   />
   ```

By following these steps, you can extend `FieldOptions` with custom options that can be utilized throughout your project.

### Extending Remult's `context` Property for Request-Specific Information

Augmenting Remult's `context` property is particularly useful because it allows you to store and access request-specific information throughout your code. This can be especially handy for including data from the request and utilizing it in entities or backend methods.

For example, you can add a custom property `origin` to the `RemultContext` interface:

```ts
declare module 'remult' {
  export interface RemultContext {
    origin?: string // [!code highlight]
  }
}
```

Then, set the `origin` property in the `initRequest` option in the `api.ts` file:

```ts
export const api = remultExpress({
  initRequest: async (_, req) => {
    remult.context.origin = req.headers.origin // [!code highlight]
  },
  entities: [Task],
  //...
})
```

You can now use the `origin` property anywhere in your code, for example:

```ts
@BackendMethod({ allowed: Roles.admin })
static async doSomethingImportant() {
  console.log(remult.context.origin); // [!code highlight]
}
```

or in an entity's saving event:

```ts
@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  saving: task => {
    task.lastUpdateDate = new Date();
    task.lastUpdateUser = remult.user?.name;
    task.lastUpdateOrigin = remult.context.origin; // [!code highlight]
  },
  //...
});
```

By leveraging module augmentation, you can tailor Remult to your specific needs, adding custom options and extending interfaces to suit your application's requirements.


# Integrations - Open API

# Adding Swagger and openApi

In short, swagger provides a quick UI that describes the api which is exposed by the application.

To add swagger to a `remult` application follow these steps:

1. Install the `swagger-ui-express` package:

   ```sh
   npm i swagger-ui-express
   npm i --save-dev @types/swagger-ui-express
   ```

2. In the `/src/server/index.ts` file add the following code:

   ```ts{2,6-9}
   import express from 'express';
   import swaggerUi from 'swagger-ui-express';
   import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express';

   const app = express();
   let api = remultExpress();

   app.use(api);
   const openApiDocument = api.openApiDoc({ title: "remult-react-todo" });
   app.get("/api/openApi.json", (req, res) => {res.json(openApiDocument)});
   app.use('/api/docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(openApiDocument));

   app.listen(3002, () => console.log("Server started"));
   ```

## Adding Swagger UI to a NextJs App

To add swagger UI to a `NextJs` application follow these steps:

1. Install the following packages:

   ```sh
   # With npm
   npm i swagger-ui-react
   npm i -D @types/swagger-ui-react

   # With yarn
   yarn add swagger-ui-react
   yarn add -D @types/swagger-ui-react
   ```

2. Get the openApi document from RemultNextAppServer:

   ```ts
   // src/api.ts
   import { Task } from '@/shared/Task'
   import { TasksController } from '@/shared/TasksController'
   import { remultNextApp } from 'remult/remult-next'

   export const api = remultNextApp({
     admin: true,
     entities: [Task],
     controllers: [TasksController],
   })

   // Export this here 👇
   export const openApiDoc = api.openApiDoc({
     title: 'Todo App',
   })

   export const { POST, PUT, DELETE, GET } = api
   ```

3. Create a new page to render Swagger UI:

   ```tsx
   // src/app/api-doc/page.tsx
   import { openApiDoc } from '@/api' // 👈 Import the openApiDoc you exported earlier
   import ReactSwagger from './react-swagger'

   export default async function IndexPage() {
     return (
       <section className="container">
         <ReactSwagger spec={openApiDoc} />
       </section>
     )
   }
   ```

   ```tsx
   // src/app/api-doc/react-swagger.tsx
   'use client'

   import SwaggerUI from 'swagger-ui-react'
   import 'swagger-ui-react/swagger-ui.css'

   type Props = {
     spec: Record<string, any>
   }

   function ReactSwagger({ spec }: Props) {
     return <SwaggerUI spec={spec} />
   }

   export default ReactSwagger
   ```

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api-doc` to see the Swagger UI.

# Integrations - GraphQL

# Adding Graphql

To add graphql to a `remult` application follow these steps:

1. Install the `graphql-yoga` packages:
   ```sh
   npm i graphql-yoga
   ```

## Express:

In the `/src/server/index.ts` file add the following code:

```ts{3-4,12-22}
import express from 'express';
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express';
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { remultGraphql } from 'remult/graphql';

const app = express()
const entities = [Task]
let api = remultExpress({
   entities
});
app.use(api);
const { typeDefs, resolvers } = remultGraphql({
   entities
});
const yoga = createYoga({
   graphqlEndpoint: '/api/graphql',
   schema: (createSchema({
      typeDefs,
      resolvers
   }))
})
app.use(yoga.graphqlEndpoint, api.withRemult, yoga)
app.listen(3002, () => console.log("Server started"));
```

## Next App Router

```ts
// Next.js Custom Route Handler: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { remultGraphql } from 'remult/graphql'
import { api } from '../../../api'
import { Task } from '../../../shared/task'

const { typeDefs, resolvers } = remultGraphql({
  entities: [Task],
})

const yoga = createYoga({
  // While using Next.js file convention for routing, we need to configure Yoga to use the correct endpoint
  graphqlEndpoint: '/api/graphql',
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
  }),
  // Yoga needs to know how to create a valid Next response
  fetchAPI: { Response },
})

const handleRequest = (request: any, ctx: any) =>
  api.withRemult(() => yoga.handleRequest(request, ctx))

export { handleRequest as GET, handleRequest as POST }
```

## Svelte

`src/routes/api/graphql/+server.ts`

```ts
import type { RequestEvent } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { remultGraphql } from 'remult/graphql'
import { Task } from '../../../shared/Task'

const { typeDefs, resolvers } = remultGraphql({
  entities: [Task],
})

const yogaApp = createYoga<RequestEvent>({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
  }),
  // While using Next.js file convention for routing, we need to configure Yoga to use the correct endpoint
  graphqlEndpoint: '/api/graphql',

  fetchAPI: { Response },
})

export { yogaApp as GET, yogaApp as OPTIONS, yogaApp as POST }
```



# API Reference - Entity

# Entity
Decorates classes that should be used as entities.
Receives a key and an array of EntityOptions.

#### example:
```ts
// as an object
@Entity("tasks",{ allowApiCrud:true })
```


#### example:
```ts
// as an arrow function that receives `remult` as a parameter
@Entity("tasks", (options,remult) => options.allowApiCrud = true)
```
## caption
A human readable name for the entity
## allowApiRead
Determines if this Entity is available for get requests using Rest Api


#### description:
Determines if one has any access to the data of an entity.

## allowApiUpdate
Determines if this entity can be updated through the api.


#### see:
 - [allowed](http://remult.dev/docs/allowed.html)
 - [Access Control](https://remult.dev/docs/access-control)

## allowApiDelete

 - [Access Control](https://remult.dev/docs/access-control)

## allowApiCrud
sets  the `allowApiUpdate`, `allowApiDelete` and `allowApiInsert` properties in a single set
## apiPrefilter
An optional filter that determines which rows can be queried using the API.
This filter is applied to all CRUD operations to ensure that only authorized data is accessible.

Use `apiPrefilter` to restrict data based on user profile or other conditions.


#### example:
```ts
// Only include non-archived items in API responses
apiPrefilter: { archive: false }
```


#### example:
```ts
// Allow admins to access all rows, but restrict non-admins to non-archived items
apiPrefilter: () => remult.isAllowed("admin") ? {} : { archive: false }
```


#### see:
[EntityFilter](https://remult.dev/docs/access-control.html#filtering-accessible-rows)
## apiPreprocessFilter
An optional function that allows for preprocessing or modifying the EntityFilter for a specific entity type
before it is used in API CRUD operations. This function can be used to enforce additional access control
rules or adjust the filter based on the current context or specific request.


#### example:
```typescript
@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  apiPreprocessFilter: async (filter, { getPreciseValues }) => {
    // Ensure that users can only query tasks for specific customers
    const preciseValues = await getPreciseValues();

      throw new ForbiddenError("You must specify a valid customerId filter");
    }
    return filter;
  }
})
```
## backendPreprocessFilter
Similar to apiPreprocessFilter, but for backend operations.
## backendPrefilter
A filter that will be used for all queries from this entity both from the API and from within the backend.


#### example:
```ts
backendPrefilter: { archive:false }
```


#### see:
[EntityFilter](http://remult.dev/docs/entityFilter.html)
## defaultOrderBy
An order by to be used, in case no order by was specified


#### example:
```ts
defaultOrderBy: { name: "asc" }
```


#### example:
```ts
defaultOrderBy: { price: "desc", name: "asc" }
```
## saving
An event that will be fired before the Entity will be saved to the database.
If the `error` property of the entity's ref or any of its fields will be set, the save will be aborted and an exception will be thrown.
this is the place to run logic that we want to run in any case before an entity is saved.


#### example:
```ts
@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  saving: async (task, e) => {
    if (e.isNew) {
      task.createdAt = new Date(); // Set the creation date for new tasks.
    }
    task.lastUpdated = new Date(); // Update the last updated date.
  },
})

# API Reference - Validation

# Validation

Validation is a key part of any application, and you will see that it's builtin Remult ! Let's dive into it...

First of all, some props brings automatic validation, for example `required` and `minLength` for strings :

```ts
@Fields.string({ minLength: 5 })
title = ''
```

You can establish your own validation rules by using the `validate` prop and do any custom code you want :

```ts
@Fields.string({
   validate: (task)=> task.title.length > 5 || "too short"
})
title = ''
```

You want to focus only on the value?

```ts
@Fields.string({
   validate: valueValidator(value => value.length > 5)
})
title = ''
```

The `validate` prop can also use buildin validators like this :

```ts
import { Validators } from 'remult'

@Fields.string({
   validate: Validators.minLength(5)
})
title = ''
```

It supports array of validators as well :

```ts
import { Validators } from 'remult'

@Fields.string({
   validate: [
      Validators.minLength(5),
      Validators.maxLength(10),
      (task)=> task.title.startsWith('No') || "Need to start with No"
   ]
})
title = ''
```

Some validators like `unique` is running on the backend side, and nothing changes, you just have to use it :

```ts
import { Validators } from 'remult'

@Fields.string({
   validate: [
      Validators.minLength(5),
      Validators.unique()
   ]
})
title = ''
```

Also in custom validator you can check if you are in the backend or not :

```ts
import { Validators, isBackend } from 'remult'

@Fields.string({
   validate: [
      Validators.unique(),
      (task) => {
         if (isBackend()) {
            // check something else...
            // throw "a custom message"
         }
      }
   ]
})
title = ''
```

If you want to customize the error message, you can do it globally :

```ts
Validators.unique.defaultMessage = 'Existe déjà!'
```

const results = await repo.groupBy({
  group: ['country', 'city'],
  sum: ['salary'],
  where: {
    salary: { $ne: 1000 },
  },
  orderBy: {
    country: 'asc',
    salary: {
      sum: 'desc',
    },
  },
});

// Accessing the results:
console.log(results[0].country); // 'uk'
console.log(results[0].city); // 'London'

## aggregate
Performs an aggregation on the repository's entity type based on the specified options.


#### returns:
The result of the aggregation.


#### example:
```ts
// Aggregating  (summing the salary field across all items):
const totalSalary = await repo.aggregate({
  sum: ['salary'],
});
console.log(totalSalary.salary.sum); // Outputs the total sum of salaries
```

Arguments:
* **options** - The options for the aggregation.
## query
Fetches data from the repository in a way that is optimized for handling large sets of entity objects.

Unlike the `find` method, which returns an array, the `query` method returns an iterable `QueryResult` object.
This allows for more efficient data handling, particularly in scenarios that involve paging through large amounts of data.

The method supports pagination and aggregation in a single request. When aggregation options are provided,
the result will include both the items from the current page and the results of the requested aggregation.

The `query` method is designed for asynchronous iteration using the `for await` statement.


#### example:
```ts
// Basic usage with asynchronous iteration:
for await (const task of taskRepo.query()) {
  // Perform some operation on each task
}
```


#### example:
```ts
// Querying with pagination:
const query = taskRepo.query({
  where: { completed: false },
  pageSize: 100,
});

let paginator = await query.paginator();
console.log('Number of items on the current page:', paginator.items.length);
console.log('Total pages:', Math.ceil(paginator.aggregate.$count / 100));

if (paginator.hasNextPage) {
  paginator = await paginator.nextPage();
  console.log('Items on the next page:', paginator.items.length);
}
```


#### example:
```ts
// Querying with aggregation:
const query = await repo.query({
  where: { completed: false },
  pageSize: 50,
  aggregates: {
    sum: ['salary'],
    average: ['age'],
  }
});

let paginator = await query.paginator();
// Accessing paginated items
console.table(paginator.items);

// Accessing aggregation results
console.log('Total salary:', paginator.aggregates.salary.sum); // Sum of all salaries
console.log('Average age:', paginator.aggregates.age.average);  // Average age
```

Arguments:
* **options**
## count
Returns a count of the items matching the criteria.


#### see:
[EntityFilter](http://remult.dev/docs/entityFilter.html)


#### example:
```ts
await taskRepo.count({ completed:false })
```

#### example:
```ts
const error = repo.validate(task);
if (error){
  alert(error.message);
  alert(error.modelState.title);//shows the specific error for the title field
}
// Can also be used to validate specific fields
const error = repo.validate(task,"title")
```

Arguments:
* **item**
* **fields**
## save
saves an item or item[] to the data source. It assumes that if an `id` value exists, it's an existing row - otherwise it's a new row


#### example:
```ts
await taskRepo.save({...task, completed:true })
```

Arguments:
* **item**
## insert
Insert an item or item[] to the data source

* **options**
   * **where** - filters the data
   
   
   #### see:
   [EntityFilter](http://remult.dev/docs/entityFilter.html)
   * **set**
## upsert
Inserts a new entity or updates an existing entity based on the specified criteria.
If an entity matching the `where` condition is found, it will be updated with the provided `set` values.
If no matching entity is found, a new entity will be created with the given data.

The `upsert` method ensures that a row exists based on the `where` condition: if no entity is found, a new one is created.
It can handle both single and multiple upserts.


#### returns:
A promise that resolves with the inserted or updated entity, or an array of entities if multiple options were provided.


#### example:
```ts
// Upserting a single entity: updates 'task a' if it exists, otherwise creates it.
taskRepo.upsert({ where: { title: 'task a' }, set: { completed: true } });
```


#### example:
```ts
// Upserting a single entity without additional `set` values: ensures that a row with the title 'task a' exists.
taskRepo.upsert({ where: { title: 'task a' } });
```


#### example:
```ts
// Upserting multiple entities: ensures both 'task a' and 'task b' exist, updating their `completed` status if found.
taskRepo.upsert([
  { where: { title: 'task a' }, set: { completed: true } },
  { where: { title: 'task b' }, set: { completed: true } }
]);

- true/false

```ts
{
  allowApiRead: true
}
```

- a Role - Checks if the current user has this role.

```ts
{
  allowApiRead: 'admin'

The Allowed for Instance method accepts two parameters:

1. The relevant `remult` object
2. The relevant entity instance

For Example:

```ts
@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
    allowApiUpdate: (task) => remult.isAllowed("admin") && !task!.completed

## apiPrefix
Used to determine the route for the BackendMethod.


#### example:
```ts
{allowed:true, apiPrefix:'someFolder/'}
```
## transactional
Controls whether this `BackendMethod` runs within a database transaction. If set to `true`, the method will either complete entirely or fail without making any partial changes. If set to `false`, the method will not be transactional and may result in partial changes if it fails.


#### default:
```ts
true
```


#### example:
```ts
{allowed: true, transactional: false}
```

# API Reference - REST API Spec

# Entity Rest Api Breakdown

All entities automatically expose a rest API based on the parameters defined in its decorator.

The API supports the following actions (we'll use the `products` entity as an example, and a specific product with an id=7):

| Http Method | Description                                                                         | example         | requires       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| GET         | returns an array of rows                                                            | /api/products   | allowApiRead   |
| GET         | returns a single row based on its id                                                | /api/products/7 | allowApiRead   |
| POST        | creates a new row based on the object sent in the body, and returns the new row     | /api/products   | allowApiInsert |
| PUT         | updates an existing row based on the object sent in the body and returns the result | /api/products/7 | allowApiUpdate |
| DELETE      | deletes an existing row                                                             | /api/products/7 | allowApiDelete |

## Sort

Add \_sort and \_order (ascending order by default)

```
https://mySite.com/api/products?_sort=price&_order=desc
```

## Filter

You can filter the rows using different operators

```
https://mySite.com/api/products?price.gte=5&price.lte=10
```

### Filter Operators

| operator     | description           | example                                            |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`       | Equal To              | price=10                                           |
| .ne          | Not Equal             | price.ne=10                                        |
| .in          | is in json array      | price.in=%5B10%2C20%5D _(url encoded - `[10,20]`)_ |
| .contains    | Contains a string     | name.contains=ee                                   |
| .notContains | Not contains a string | name.notContains=ee                                |
| .startsWith  | Starts with a string  | name.startsWith=ee                                 |
| .endsWith    | Ends with a string    | name.endsWith=ee                                   |
| .gt          | Greater than          | price.gt=10                                        |
| .gte         | Greater than or equal | price.gte=10                                       |
| .lt          | Lesser than           | price.lt=10                                        |

# Introducing Remult: The Backend to Frontend Framework You Always Wanted

# Introducing Remult: The Backend to Frontend Framework You Always Wanted

Application developers, as their name implies, like to develop applications––they ultimately care very little about frontend vs. backend, and really just want to deliver value to users.  Being an application developer myself, and very much like other application developers, one of the things that constantly drives my decision making when selecting tools and frameworks is the fact that I’m also quite lazy. 

My main objective is to be able to ship applications with as little effort as possible, and my pet peeve is silly repetitive, mechanical tasks that make me die a little inside every time I need to perform them. For example, I don’t like to have to remember to align things that don’t automatically align themselves, as one common example of a repetitive task that is completely superfluous.  I guess my trademark is that when I encounter challenges, I will always look for ways to automate a solution.  (Like the app I once built in the 90s to send a romantic text message to my girlfriend once a day––to overcome my own romantic shortcomings).

I've been building tools and frameworks to increase developer productivity most of my professional career.  This all started back in 2006, when I identified a need for modernizing applications created using a low-code generator, to C#.NET.  I decided to not only create a fully automated migration solution but more importantly, create a C# class library that would enable an equivalent speed of development that was previously made possible by using the low-code tool.

This was a very high bar, as developers that are used to working in low-code are also often the type that don’t really like the details or the bits and bytes of the internals.  A developer who is happy to use low-code tooling is essentially only looking to write code that gets a specific task done.  Being able to replicate this in a coding framework needed to provide as seamless and simple of an experience that they had until now––but with code.  

Hundreds of organizations have used Firefly’s migration solution, from fortune 500s and governments to small software houses. The C# library provided   is still in use today, enabling “low-code level”, highly productive application development, combined with the flexibility of code.  

The ability to efficiently ship full applications with a simple library, to me, felt like something that had to be portable and replicated to the modern web.  The wheels began to turn.

## What Brought Us Here

Like many other web developers, when Node.js came out, I was excited about the promise of backend to frontend that came with it, that finally we don’t have to learn two languages to build a full stack application.  Just the sheer mental switch between languages––for me it was C# on the backend and then Javascript on the frontend, and this always came with its toll of friction and context switch that could even be considered debilitating to my dev workflow.

Even with the possibility Node.js presented of enabling Javascript on both ends, still not many developers chose to do so. All of the best practices and learning resources continued to recommend using two separate approaches for backend and frontend, and a complete separation of tools, libraries and frameworks with very little sharing of code and patterns for frontend and backend.

This modus operandi of having two separate languages each with its own syntax and logic, creates the need for a lot of repetitive boilerplate, such as code to pull the data from the database (for every single application entity), code to expose entity CRUD operations as an API, with four, five or even six different routes per entity, methods for these routes, and these all would again get duplicated and reused hundreds of times, and each time further complicated. You get the idea.  

And this is just on the backend. 

Now on the frontend you have reverse code for this, you have code that takes these JSON responses and rebuilds objects out of these, for you to be able use them on the frontend.  Just trying to get data from the database to the users, but in the meantime, you need code to read the database, serialize the JSON, send it over a route, only to have to deserialize and query it on the frontend, just to get it in front of the user.  

This is all mechanical code that practically does nothing.  Where, eventually, all of this is repeatable.  

Wait, there’s more. Every API route needs to be able to fetch data, provide some sort of server-side paging, sorting and filtering, delete, insert, and update, all of these very generic actions are repeated over and over by all developers building full stack applications all the time in millions of lines of code.  

Now let’s talk about concerns that cross over from the frontend to the backend that get duplicated. Up until a couple of years ago the frontend and backend were at best sharing types, but there’s so much more to types than just strings or integers.  

Commons questions like: how do you serialize these from JSON and then to JSON? How do you validate them? Today, validations on the frontend and backend are operations that are completely separate.  Which begs the questions WHY?  Why should I have to remember (as a lazy developer mind you) to have to perform two separate validations on the frontend and the backend?

![Duplicate boilerplate code](./introducing-remult-part-1/boilerplate.png)

There’s also a cultural aspect with this dichotomy between frontend and backend code, where there needs to be such impeccable communication and alignment between the developers, that is almost an impossible feat.  At the end of the day,  all of those places are places of friction where things can go wrong, with two completely different developers maintaining the code.

## Enter Remult

Remember when I said that when I encounter a challenge, my first course of action is to try and automate it away?  I couldn’t fathom how in 2018 it still is not viable to be able to get the same code to run on the frontend and the backend.  I started toying with this idea to see if I could truly make this possible, improve my own productivity (and hopefully for other developers too)––from validations, to typing, through authentication and authorization, all of the typical code that’s constantly being duplicated.

### The Remult Backstory 

Remult started as a side project, without a name, and with a completely different (albeit noble) purpose.  My wife volunteered at a food bank, and as a result, I too was volunteered to participate in distributing food parcels to the needy.  One day, as I was driving to distribute the parcels, holding a paper with a list of addresses I found myself getting lost in places you don’t want to get lost, and I knew I had to build them an app to help volunteers navigate efficiently.  I knew I could solve a lot of friction in the process of delivering food parcels to the needy through code––which is what I do best, and I wanted to focus on building the actual application and its capabilities, and not the pieces that hold it together.

So I built an application for inventory and distribution of our local food bank in Even Yehuda, an application they could use to generate distribution lists for volunteer couriers, and for the couriers to be able to navigate to and report back on delivery. I wrote the app, and at the same time the framework as well, the very framework I wanted to have when building web applications.  One that would focus on the data flow from the backend database all the way through to the frontend framework (the framework of your choice––whether Angular, React, or Vue––it shouldn’t matter). 

![Food Bank App](./introducing-remult-part-1/food-bank-app.jpg)

Instead of having to go through the entire process described above of serializing objects for every HTTP call on the frontend, and then reversing the entire process back into JSON from the backend to the frontend––this framework now made it possible to query on the frontend, using objects, and then automated the entire process from the frontend to the backend and back again.  I finally had the framework I dreamed of that eliminates the need to write all of this boilerplate, repetitive, duct tape code over and over again.

With its growth and use, a colleague and I worked on the framework, invested in its ability to scale and its stability, improved its API that underwent several iterations, and added many features.  The application built upon this frameworkIt was quickly adopted by other food banks around Israel who often encountered similar challenges with parcel delivery.  Our application after its first year managed to help distribute 17,000 parcels from food banks around Israel.  We were quite proud of this achievement––we started feeling like our framework could possibly withstand the test of scale, but we had no idea what was to come next..  

## What COVID Taught us About Scale and Security

Then COVID hit––and lock downs cut people in need off from the entire world.  Suddenly, the need to distribute food to the elderly and disabled skyrocketed.  The demand grew from 17,000 parcels annually to 17,000 parcels a day.  The app was then contributed for free to municipalities, NGOs and even the IDF’s Home Front to enable better inventory, allocation and distribution of parcels around Israel.

Once the application was adopted by the IDF, it also underwent a battery of security testing––cyber and penetration testing, which leveled up its security significantly.  The backend to frontend framework, and the application built upon it that was supposed to be just an experiment, withstood the scale of half a million parcel distributions in 2020 alone, and since then has maintained a similar number and is only growing.  During COVID it was adopted by  multiple countries around the globe––from Australia, to the EU, USA, and South Africa––to respond to similar needs during the pandemic.  

This is the backbone upon which Remult was built and battle tested, with all of this running on a $16-a-month Heroku server.  

Once the pandemic was behind us, my co-creator and I realized we had learned a lot.  We understood the framework was robust and could scale, was aligned with security best practices, and delivered the promise of democratizing the ability to build full stack applications without all of the known friction.

We wanted to share this with the world. 

So we open sourced the framework, to enable other lazy developers like us to be able to invest their energy in writing excellent applications that deliver value to users, and not on repeatable, mechanical code that apparently actually **can be automated** and shared by the backend and frontend.

In our next post, we’ll do a roundup of tools in the ecosystem looking to solve similar challenges though different approaches, and unpack where Remult fits in, and what it’s optimized for.


# react - Tutorial - Setup

# Build a Full-Stack React Application

### Create a simple todo app with Remult using a React frontend

In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple app to manage a task list. We'll use `React` for the UI, `Node.js` + `Express.js` for the API server, and Remult as our full-stack CRUD framework. For deployment to production, we'll use [railway.app](https://railway.app/) and a `PostgreSQL` database.

By the end of the tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Remult and how to use it to accelerate and simplify full stack app development.

This tutorial requires setting up a React project, an API server project, and a few lines of code to add Remult.

You can either **use a starter project** to speed things up, or go through the **step-by-step setup**.

## Option 1: Clone the Starter Project

1. Clone the _react-vite-express-starter_ repository from GitHub and install its dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/remult/react-vite-express-starter.git remult-react-todo
cd remult-react-todo
npm install
```

2. Open your IDE.
3. Open a terminal and run the `dev` npm script.

```sh
npm run dev
```

4. Open another terminal and run the `dev-node` npm script

```sh
npm run dev-node
```

The default "Vite + React" app main screen should be available at the default Vite dev server address [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173).

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.

## Option 2: Step-by-step Setup

### Create a React project using Vite

Create the new React project.

```sh
npm create -y vite@latest remult-react-todo -- --template react-ts
cd remult-react-todo
```

::: warning Run into issues scaffolding the Vite project?
See [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) for help.
:::

In this tutorial, we'll be using the root folder created by `Vite` as the root folder for our server project as well.

### Install required packages

We need `Express` to serve our app's API, and, of course, `Remult`. For development, we'll use [tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) to run the API server.

```sh
npm i express remult
npm i --save-dev @types/express tsx
```

### Create the API server project

The starter API server TypeScript project contains a single module that initializes `Express`, and begins listening for API requests.

1. Open your IDE.

2. Create a `server` folder under the `src/` folder created by Vite.

3. Create an `index.ts` file in the `src/server/` folder with the following code:

```ts [index.ts]
// src/server/index.ts

import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.listen(3002, () => console.log('Server started'))
```

### Bootstrap Remult in the back-end

Remult is loaded in the back-end as an `Express middleware`.

1. Create an `api.ts` file in the `src/server/` folder with the following code:

```ts
// src/server/api.ts

import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'

export const api = remultExpress()
```

2. Add the highlighted code lines to register the middleware in the main server module `index.ts`.

```ts{4,7}
// src/server/index.ts

import express from "express"
import { api } from "./api.js"

const app = express()
app.use(api)

app.listen(3002, () => console.log("Server started"))
```

::: warning ESM
In this tutorial we will be using `esm` for the node.js server - that means that where ever we import a file we have to include the `.js` suffix for it as we did above in the `import { api } from "./api.js` statement
:::

### Final tweaks

Our full stack starter project is almost ready. Let's complete these final configurations.

#### Enable TypeScript decorators in Vite

Add the following entry to the `defineConfig` section of the `vite.config.ts` file to enable the use of decorators in the React app.

```ts{6-12}
// vite.config.ts

// ...
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  esbuild: {
    tsconfigRaw: {
      compilerOptions: {
        experimentalDecorators: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Create the server tsconfig file

In the root folder, create a TypeScript configuration file `tsconfig.server.json` for the server project.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "module": "nodenext"
  },
  "include": ["src/server/**/*", "src/shared/**/*"]
}
```

#### Proxy API requests from Vue DevServer (vite) to the API server

The react app created in this tutorial is intended to be served from the same domain as its API.
However, for development, the API server will be listening on `http://localhost:3002`, while the react app is served from the default `http://localhost:5173`.

We'll use the [proxy](https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-proxy) feature of Vite to divert all calls for `http://localhost:5173/api` to our dev API server.

Configure the proxy by adding the following entry to the `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts{6}
// vite.config.ts

//...
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: { proxy: { "/api": "http://localhost:3002" } },
  esbuild: {
    tsconfigRaw: {
      compilerOptions: {
        experimentalDecorators: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Run the app

1. Open a terminal and start the vite dev server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

2. Add an `npm` script named `dev-node` to start the dev API server in the `package.json`.

```json
// package.json

"dev-node": "tsx watch --tsconfig tsconfig.server.json src/server"
```

3. Open another terminal and start the `node` server

```sh
npm run dev-node
```

The server is now running and listening on port 3002. `tsx` is watching for file changes and will restart the server when code changes are saved.

The default "Vite + React" app main screen should be available at the default Vite dev server address [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173).

### Remove React default styles

The react default styles won't fit our todo app. If you'd like a nice-looking app, replace the contents of `src/index.css` with [this CSS file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remult/react-vite-express-starter/master/src/index.css). Otherwise, you can simply **delete the contents of `src/index.css`**.

### Setup completed

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.



# react - Tutorial - Entities

# Entities

Let's start coding the app by defining the `Task` entity class.

The `Task` entity class will be used:

- As a model class for client-side code
- As a model class for server-side code
- By `remult` to generate API endpoints, API queries, and database commands

The `Task` entity class we're creating will have an auto-generated `id` field, a `title` field, a `completed` field and an auto-generated `createdAt` field. The entity's API route ("tasks") will include endpoints for all `CRUD` operations.

## Define the Model

1. Create a `shared` folder under the `src` folder. This folder will contain code shared between frontend and backend.

2. Create a file `Task.ts` in the `src/shared/` folder, with the following code:

```ts
// src/shared/Task.ts

import { Entity, Fields } from 'remult'

@Entity('tasks', {
  allowApiCrud: true,
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''

  @Fields.string()
  title = ''

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false

  @Fields.createdAt()
  createdAt?: Date
}
```

3. In the server's `api` module, register the `Task` entity with Remult by adding `entities: [Task]` to an `options` object you pass to the `remultExpress()` middleware:

```ts{4,7}
// src/server/api.ts

import { remultExpress } from "remult/remult-express"
import { Task } from "../shared/Task.js"

export const api = remultExpress({
  entities: [Task]
})
```

::: warning ESM
In this tutorial we will be using `esm` for the node.js server - that means that where ever we import a file we have to include the `.js` suffix for it as we did above in the `import { Task } from "../shared/Task.js"` statement
:::

The [@Entity](../../docs/ref_entity.md) decorator tells Remult this class is an entity class. The decorator accepts a `key` argument (used to name the API route and as a default database collection/table name), and an `options` argument used to define entity-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial.

To initially allow all CRUD operations for tasks, we set the option [allowApiCrud](../../docs/ref_entity.md#allowapicrud) to `true`.

The [@Fields.cuid](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-cuid) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a short random id using the [cuid](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid) library. This value can't be changed after the entity is created.

The [@Fields.string](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-string) decorator tells Remult the `title` property is an entity data field of type `String`. This decorator is also used to define field-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial and the same goes for `@Fields.boolean` and the `completed` property.

The [@Fields.createdAt](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-createdat) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a `createdAt` field with the current date and time.

::: tip
For a complete list of supported field types, see the [Field Types](../../docs/field-types.md) section in the Remult documentation.
:::

## Test the API

Now that the `Task` entity is defined, we can start using the REST API to query and add a tasks.

1. Open a browser with the url: [http://localhost:3002/api/tasks](http://localhost:3002/api/tasks), and you'll see that you get an empty array.

2. Use `curl` to `POST` a new task - _Clean car_.

```sh
curl http://localhost:3002/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"Clean car\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

3. Refresh the browser for the url: [http://localhost:3002/api/tasks](http://localhost:3002/api/tasks) and see that the array now contains one item.

4. Use `curl` to `POST` a few more tasks:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3002/api/tasks -d "[{\"title\": \"Read a book\"},{\"title\": \"Take a nap\", \"completed\":true },{\"title\": \"Pay bills\"},{\"title\": \"Do laundry\"}]" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

- Note that the `POST` endpoint can accept a single `Task` or an array of `Task`s.

5. Refresh the browser again, to see that the tasks were stored in the db.

::: warning Wait, where is the backend database?
While remult supports [many relational and non-relational databases](https://remult.dev/docs/databases.html), in this tutorial we start by storing entity data in a backend **JSON file**. Notice that a `db` folder has been created under the root folder, with a `tasks.json` file containing the created tasks.
:::

## Admin UI

### Enabling the Admin UI

Add the Admin UI to your React application by setting the `admin` option to `true` in the `remultExpress()`

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import { Task } from '../shared/Task.js'

export const api = remultExpress({
  entities: [Task],
  admin: true, // Enable the Admin UI
})
```

:::

### Accessing and Using the Admin UI

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/api/admin` to access the Admin UI. Here, you can perform CRUD operations on your entities, view their relationships via the Diagram entry, and ensure secure management with the same validations and authorizations as your application.

![Remult Admin](/remult-admin.png)

### Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Directly create, update, and delete tasks through the Admin UI.
- **Entity Diagram**: Visualize relationships between entities for better data structure understanding.
- **Security**: Operations are secure, adhering to application-defined rules.

## Display the Task List

Let's start developing the web app by displaying the list of existing tasks in a React component.

Replace the contents of `src/App.tsx` with the following code:

```tsx
// src/App.tsx

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { remult } from 'remult'
import { Task } from './shared/Task'

const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task)

export default function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([])

  useEffect(() => {
    taskRepo.find().then(setTasks)
  }, [])
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todos</h1>
      <main>
        {tasks.map((task) => {
          return (
            <div key={task.id}>
              <input type="checkbox" checked={task.completed} />
              {task.title}
            </div>
          )
        })}
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet:

- `taskRepo` is a Remult [Repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md) object used to fetch and create Task entity objects.
- `tasks` is a Task array React state to hold the list of tasks.
- React's useEffect hook is used to call the Remult [repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md)'s [find](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method to fetch tasks from the server, once when the React component is loaded.

After the browser refreshes, the list of tasks appears.



# react - Tutorial - Paging, Sorting and Filtering

# Paging, Sorting and Filtering

The RESTful API created by Remult supports **server-side paging, sorting, and filtering**. Let's use that to limit, sort and filter the list of tasks.

## Limit Number of Fetched Tasks

Since our database may eventually contain a lot of tasks, it make sense to use a **paging strategy** to limit the number of tasks retrieved in a single fetch from the back-end database.

Let's limit the number of fetched tasks to `20`.

In the `useEffect` hook, pass an `options` argument to the `find` method call and set its `limit` property to 20.

```ts{6}
// src/App.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20
    })
    .then(setTasks)
}, [])
```

There aren't enough tasks in the database for this change to have an immediate effect, but it will have one later on when we'll add more tasks.

::: tip
To query subsequent pages, use the [Repository.find()](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method's `page` option.
:::

## Sorting By Creation Date

We would like old tasks to appear first in the list, and new tasks to appear last. Let's sort the tasks by their `createdAt` field.

In the `useEffect` hook, set the `orderBy` property of the `find` method call's `option` argument to an object that contains the fields you want to sort by.
Use "asc" and "desc" to determine the sort order.

```ts{7}
// src/App.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
    })
    .then(setTasks)
}, [])
```

## Server side Filtering

Remult supports sending filter rules to the server to query only the tasks that we need.

Adjust the `useEffect` hook to fetch only `completed` tasks.

```ts{8}
// src/App.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" },
      where: { completed: true }
    })
    .then(setTasks)
}, [])
```

::: warning Note
Because the `completed` field is of type `boolean`, the argument is **compile-time checked to be of the `boolean` type**. Settings the `completed` filter to `undefined` causes it to be ignored by Remult.
:::

Play with different filtering values, and eventually comment it out, since we do need all the tasks

```ts{8}
// src/App.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
      //where: { completed: true },
    })
    .then(setTasks)
}, [])
```

::: tip Learn more
Explore the reference for a [comprehensive list of filtering options](../../docs/entityFilter.md).
:::



# react - Tutorial - CRUD Operations

# CRUD Operations

## Adding new tasks

Now that we can see the list of tasks, it's time to add a few more.

Add the highlighted `newTaskTitle` state and `addTask` function the App Component

```ts{5-16}
// src/App.tsx

export default function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([])
  const [newTaskTitle, setNewTaskTitle] = useState("")

  const addTask = async (e: FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    try {
      const newTask = await taskRepo.insert({ title: newTaskTitle })
      setTasks([...tasks, newTask])
      setNewTaskTitle("")
    } catch (error: unknown) {
      alert((error as { message: string }).message)
    }
  }
  //...
```

- the call to `taskRepo.insert` will make a post request to the server, insert the new task to the `db`, and return the new `Task` object with all it's info (including the id generated by the database)

::: warning Import FormEvent
This code requires adding an import of `FormEvent` from `react`.
:::

Next let's adjust the `tsx` to display a form to add new tasks

```tsx{7-14}
// src/App.tsx

return (
  <div>
    <h1>Todos</h1>
    <main>
      <form onSubmit={addTask}>
        <input
          value={newTaskTitle}
          placeholder="What needs to be done?"
          onChange={e => setNewTaskTitle(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button>Add</button>
      </form>
      {tasks.map(task => {
        return (
          <div key={task.id}>
            <input type="checkbox" checked={task.completed} />
            {task.title}
          </div>
        )
      })}
    </main>
  </div>
)
```

Try adding a few tasks to see how it works

## Mark Tasks as completed

Modify the contents of the `tasks.map` iteration within the `App` component to include the following `setCompleted` function and call it in the input's `onChange` event.

```tsx{5-6,8-9,16}
// src/App.tsx

{
  tasks.map(task => {
    const setTask = (value: Task) =>
      setTasks(tasks => tasks.map(t => (t === task ? value : t)))

    const setCompleted = async (completed: boolean) =>
      setTask(await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed }))

    return (
      <div key={task.id}>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={task.completed}
          onChange={e => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
        />
        {task.title}
      </div>
    )
  })
}
```

- The `setTask` function is used to replace the state of the changed task in the `tasks` array
- The `taskRepo.save` method update the `task` to the server and returns the updated value

## Rename Tasks and Save them

To make the tasks in the list updatable, we'll bind the `tasks` React state to `input` elements and add a _Save_ button to save the changes to the backend database.

Modify the contents of the `tasks.map` iteration within the `App` component to include the following `setTitle` and `saveTask` functions and add an `input` and a save `button`.

```tsx{11,13-19,28-29}
// src/App.tsx

{
  tasks.map(task => {
    const setTask = (value: Task) =>
      setTasks(tasks => tasks.map(t => (t === task ? value : t)))

    const setCompleted = async (completed: boolean) =>
      setTask(await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed }))

    const setTitle = (title: string) => setTask({ ...task, title })

    const saveTask = async () => {
      try {
        setTask(await taskRepo.save(task))
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    return (
      <div key={task.id}>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={task.completed}
          onChange={e => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
        />
        <input value={task.title} onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)} />
        <button onClick={saveTask}>Save</button>
      </div>
    )
  })
}
```

- The `setTitle` function, called from the `input`'s `onChange` event, saves the value from the `input` to the `tasks` state.
- The `saveTask` function, called from the `button`'s' `onClick`event, saves the `task` object to the backend.

Make some changes and refresh the browser to verify the backend database is updated.

::: tip Browser's Network tab
As you play with these `CRUD` capabilities, monitor the network tab and see that they are all translated to `rest` api calls.
:::

## Delete Tasks

Let's add a _Delete_ button next to the _Save_ button of each task in the list.

Add the highlighted `deleteTask` function and _Delete_ `button` Within the `tasks.map` iteration in the `return` section of the `App` component.

```tsx{21-28,39}
// src/App.tsx

{
  tasks.map(task => {
    const setTask = (value: Task) =>
      setTasks(tasks => tasks.map(t => (t === task ? value : t)))

    const setCompleted = async (completed: boolean) =>
      setTask(await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed }))

    const setTitle = (title: string) => setTask({ ...task, title })

    const saveTask = async () => {
      try {
        setTask(await taskRepo.save(task))
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    const deleteTask = async () => {
      try {
        await taskRepo.delete(task)
        setTasks(tasks.filter(t => t !== task))
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    return (
      <div key={task.id}>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={task.completed}
          onChange={e => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
        />
        <input value={task.title} onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)} />
        <button onClick={saveTask}>Save</button>
        <button onClick={deleteTask}>Delete</button>
      </div>
    )
  })
}
```



# react - Tutorial - Validation

# Validation

Validating user entered data is usually required both on the client-side and on the server-side, often causing a violation of the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) design principle. **With Remult, validation code can be placed within the entity class, and Remult will run the validation logic on both the frontend and the relevant API requests.**

::: warning Handling validation errors

When a validation error occurs, Remult will throw an exception.

In this tutorial, [CRUD operations](crud.md) catch these exceptions, and alert the user.
We leave it to you to decide how to handle validation errors in your application.
:::

## Validate the Title Field

Task titles are required. Let's add a validity check for this rule.

1. In the `Task` entity class, modify the `Fields.string` decorator for the `title` field to include an object literal argument and set the object's `validate` property to `Validators.required`.

```ts{3-5}
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Fields.string({
  validate: Validators.required
})
title = ""
```

::: warning Import Validators
This code requires adding an import of `Validators` from `remult`.
:::

::: warning Manual browser refresh required
For this change to take effect, you **must manually refresh the browser**.
:::

After the browser is refreshed, try creating a new `task` or saving an existing one with an empty title - the _"Should not be empty"_ error message is displayed.

### Implicit server-side validation

The validation code we've added is called by Remult on the server-side to validate any API calls attempting to modify the `title` field.

Try making the following `POST` http request to the `http://localhost:3002/api/tasks` API route, providing an invalid title.

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3002/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

An http error is returned and the validation error text is included in the response body,

## Custom Validation

The `validate` property of the first argument of `Remult` field decorators can be set to an arrow function which will be called to validate input on both front-end and back-end.

Try something like this and see what happens:

```ts
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Fields.string<Task>({
  validate: (task) => {
    if (task.title.length < 3) throw "Too Short"
  }
})
title = ""
```

::: warning Remove Validators Import
This code no longer requires the `Validators` import from 'remult' and it should be removed
:::



# react - Tutorial - Live Queries

# Live Queries

Our todo list app can have multiple users using it at the same time. However, changes made by one user are not seen by others unless they manually refresh the browser.

Let's add realtime multiplayer capabilities to this app.

## Realtime updated todo list

Let's switch from fetching Tasks once when the React component is loaded, and manually maintaining state for CRUD operations, to using a realtime updated live query subscription **for both initial data fetching and subsequent state changes**.

1. Modify the contents of the `useEffect` hook in the `App` component:

```ts{4-5,10}
// src/App.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  return taskRepo
    .liveQuery({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
      //where: { completed: true },
    })
    .subscribe(info => setTasks(info.applyChanges))
}, [])
```

Let's review the change:

- Instead of calling the `repository`'s `find` method we now call the `liveQuery` method to define the query, and then call its `subscribe` method to establish a subscription which will update the Tasks state in realtime.
- The `subscribe` method accepts a callback with an `info` object that has 3 members:
  - `items` - an up to date list of items representing the current result - it's useful for readonly use cases.
  - `applyChanges` - a method that receives an array and applies the changes to it - we send that method to the `setTasks` state function, to apply the changes to the existing `tasks` state.
  - `changes` - a detailed list of changes that were received
- The `subscribe` method returns an `unsubscribe` function which we use as a return value for the `useEffect` hook, so that it'll be called when the component unmounts.

2. As all relevant CRUD operations (made by all users) will **immediately update the component's state**, we should remove the manual adding of new Tasks to the component's state:

```ts{7}
// src/App.tsx

const addTask = async (e: FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  try {
    // const newTask = await taskRepo.insert({ title: newTaskTitle }) <- Delete this line
    await taskRepo.insert({ title: newTaskTitle }) // <- replace with this line
    // setTasks([...tasks, newTask])   <-- this line is no longer needed
    setNewTaskTitle("")
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    alert((error as { message: string }).message)
  }
}
```

3. Optionally remove other redundant state changing code:

```tsx{11-12,18-19,28}
// src/App.tsx

//...

{
  tasks.map(task => {
    const setTask = (value: Task) =>
      setTasks(tasks => tasks.map(t => (t === task ? value : t)))

    const setCompleted = async (completed: boolean) =>
      // setTask(await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })) <- Delete this line
      await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed }) // <- replace with this line

    const setTitle = (title: string) => setTask({ ...task, title })

    const saveTask = async () => {
      try {
        // setTask(await taskRepo.save(task)) <- Delete this line
        await taskRepo.save(task) // <- replace with this line
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    const deleteTask = async () => {
      try {
        await taskRepo.delete(task)
        // setTasks(tasks.filter(t => t !== task)) <- Delete this line
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    //...
  })
}
```

Open the todo app in two (or more) browser windows/tabs, make some changes in one window and notice how the others are updated in realtime.

::: tip Under the hood
The default implementation of live-queries uses HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push realtime updates to clients, and stores live-query information in-memory.

For serverless environments _(or multi servers)_, live-query updates can be pushed using integration with third-party realtime providers, such as [Ably](https://ably.com/) (or others), and live-query information can be stored to any database supported by Remult.

# react - Tutorial - Backend methods

# Backend methods

When performing operations on multiple entity objects, performance considerations may necessitate running them on the server. **With Remult, moving client-side logic to run on the server is a simple refactoring**.

## Set All Tasks as Un/completed

Let's add two buttons to the todo app: "Set all as completed" and "Set all as uncompleted".

1. Add a `setAllCompleted` async function to the `App` function component, which accepts a `completed` boolean argument and sets the value of the `completed` field of all the tasks accordingly.

   ```ts
   // src/App.tsx

   const setAllCompleted = async (completed: boolean) => {
     for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
       await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
     }
   }
   ```

   The `for` loop iterates the array of `Task` objects returned from the backend, and saves each task back to the backend with a modified value in the `completed` field.

2. Add the two buttons to the return section of the `App` component, just before the closing `</main>` tag. Both of the buttons' `onClick` events will call the `setAllCompleted` method with the appropriate value of the `completed` argument.

   ```tsx
   // src/App.tsx

   <div>
     <button onClick={() => setAllCompleted(true)}>Set All Completed</button>
     <button onClick={() => setAllCompleted(false)}>Set All Uncompleted</button>
   </div>
   ```

Make sure the buttons are working as expected before moving on to the next step.

## Refactor from Front-end to Back-end

With the current state of the `setAllCompleted` function, each modified task being saved causes an API `PUT` request handled separately by the server. As the number of tasks in the todo list grows, this may become a performance issue.

A simple way to prevent this is to expose an API endpoint for `setAllCompleted` requests, and run the same logic on the server instead of the client.

1. Create a new `TasksController` class, in the `shared` folder, and refactor the `for` loop from the `setAllCompleted` function of the `App` function component into a new, `static`, `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController` class, which will run on the server.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

import { BackendMethod, remult } from 'remult'
import { Task } from './Task.js'

export class TasksController {
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
    const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task)

    for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
      await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
    }
  }
}
```

The `@BackendMethod` decorator tells Remult to expose the method as an API endpoint (the `allowed` property will be discussed later on in this tutorial).

**Unlike the front-end `Remult` object, the server implementation interacts directly with the database.**

2. Register `TasksController` by adding it to the `controllers` array of the `options` object passed to `remultExpress()`, in the server's `api` module:

```ts{4,8}
// src/server/api.ts

//...
import { TasksController } from "../shared/TasksController.js"

export const api = remultExpress({
  //...
  controllers: [TasksController]
})
```

3. Replace the `for` iteration in the `setAllCompleted` function of the `App` component with a call to the `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController`.

```tsx{4}
// src/App.tsx

const setAllCompleted = async (completed: boolean) => {
  await TasksController.setAllCompleted(completed)
}
```

::: warning Import TasksController
Remember to add an import of `TasksController` in `App.tsx`.
:::

::: tip Note
With Remult backend methods, argument types are compile-time checked. :thumbsup:
:::

After the browser refreshed, the _"Set all..."_ buttons function exactly the same, but much faster.



# react - Tutorial - Authentication and Authorization

# Authentication and Authorization

Our todo app is nearly functionally complete, but it still doesn't fulfill a very basic requirement - that users should log in before they can view, create or modify tasks.

Remult provides a flexible mechanism that enables placing **code-based authorization rules** at various levels of the application's API. To maintain high code cohesion, **entity and field-level authorization code should be placed in entity classes**.

**Remult is completely unopinionated when it comes to user authentication.** You are free to use any kind of authentication mechanism, and only required to provide Remult with an object which implements the Remult `UserInfo` interface.

In this tutorial, we'll use `Express`'s [cookie-session](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-session.html) middleware to store an authenticated user's session within a cookie. The `user` property of the session will be set by the API server upon a successful simplistic sign-in (based on username without password).

## Tasks CRUD Requires Sign-in

This rule is implemented within the `Task` `@Entity` decorator, by modifying the value of the `allowApiCrud` property.
This property can be set to a function that accepts a `Remult` argument and returns a `boolean` value. Let's use the `Allow.authenticated` function from Remult.

```ts{4}
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Entity("tasks", {
    allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated
})
```

::: warning Import Allow
This code requires adding an import of `Allow` from `remult`.
:::

After the browser refreshes, **the list of tasks disappeared** and the user can no longer create new tasks.

::: details Inspect the HTTP error returned by the API using cURL

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3002/api/tasks
```

:::

::: danger Authorized server-side code can still modify tasks
Although client CRUD requests to `tasks` API endpoints now require a signed-in user, the API endpoint created for our `setAllCompleted` server function remains available to unauthenticated requests. Since the `allowApiCrud` rule we implemented does not affect the server-side code's ability to use the `Task` entity class for performing database CRUD operations, **the `setAllCompleted` function still works as before**.

To fix this, let's implement the same rule using the `@BackendMethod` decorator of the `setAllCompleted` method of `TasksController`.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

@BackendMethod({ allowed: Allow.authenticated })
```

**This code requires adding an import of `Allow` from `remult`.**
:::

## User Authentication

Let's add a sign-in area to the todo app, with an `input` for typing in a `username` and a sign-in `button`. The app will have two valid `username` values - _"Jane"_ and _"Steve"_. After a successful sign-in, the sign-in area will be replaced by a "Hi [username]" message.

### Backend setup

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to install the required packages:

```sh
npm i cookie-session
npm i --save-dev @types/cookie-session
```

2. Modify the main server module `index.ts` to use the `cookie-session` Express middleware.

   ```ts{5,8-12}
   // src/server/index.ts

   //...

   import session from "cookie-session"

   const app = express()
   app.use(
     session({
       secret: process.env["SESSION_SECRET"] || "my secret"
     })
   )

   //...
   ```

   The `cookie-session` middleware stores session data, digitally signed using the value of the `secret` property, in an `httpOnly` cookie, sent by the browser to all subsequent API requests.

3. add a `shared/AuthController.ts` file and include the following code:

   ```ts add={4-6,8-12}
   // src/shared/AuthController.ts

   import { BackendMethod, remult } from 'remult'
   import type express from 'express'
   // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
   import type from 'cookie-session' // required to access the session member of the request object

   declare module 'remult' {
     export interface RemultContext {
       request?: express.Request
     }
   }

   export class AuthController {
     //
   }
   ```

   ### Code Explanation

   - We import the necessary modules from `remult` and types for `express` and `cookie-session`.
   - We extend the `RemultContext` interface to include an optional `request` property of type `express.Request`.
   - Remult will automatically set the `request` with the current request. Since Remult works with any server framework, we need to type it to the correct server, which in this case is Express. This typing gives us access to the request object and its session, managed by `cookie-session`.
   - This `request` can be accessed using `remult.context.request`.

   Next, we'll add a static list of users and a sign-in method. (In a real application, you would use a database, but for this tutorial, a static list will suffice.)

   ```ts add={1,4-17}
   const validUsers = [{ name: 'Jane' }, { name: 'Alex' }]

   export class AuthController {
     @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
     static async signIn(name: string) {
       const user = validUsers.find((user) => user.name === name)
       if (user) {
         remult.user = {
           id: user.name,
           name: user.name,
         }
         remult.context.request!.session!['user'] = remult.user
         return remult.user
       } else {
         throw Error("Invalid user, try 'Alex' or 'Jane'")
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   ### Code Explanation

   - We define a static list of valid users.
   - The `signIn` method is decorated with `@BackendMethod({ allowed: true })`, making it accessible from the frontend.
   - The method checks if the provided `name` exists in the `validUsers` list. If it does, it sets `remult.user` to an object that conforms to the `UserInfo` type from Remult and stores this user in the request session.
   - If the user is not found, it throws an error.

   Next, we'll add the sign-out method:

   ```ts add={7-11}
   export class AuthController {
     @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
     static async signIn(name: string) {
       //...
     }

     @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
     static async signOut() {
       remult.context.request!.session!['user'] = undefined
       return undefined
     }
   }
   ```

   - The `signOut` method clears the user session, making the user unauthenticated.

4. Update `remultExpress` configuration.

   ```ts{3,5,6}
   // src/server/api.ts

   import { AuthController } from '../shared/AuthController.js'

   export const api = remultExpress({
     //...
     controllers: [TaskController, AuthController]
     getUser: (req) => req.session!['user'],
   })
   ```

   ### Code Explanation

   - Register the `AuthController` so that the frontend can call its `signIn` and `signOut` methods
   - `getUser` function: The getUser function is responsible for extracting the user information from the session. If a user is found in the session, Remult will treat the request as authenticated, and this user will be used for authorization purposes.

### Frontend setup

1. Create a file `src/Auth.tsx` and place the following `Auth` component code in it:

   ```ts
   // src/Auth.tsx

   import { FormEvent, useEffect, useState } from "react";
   import { remult } from "remult";
   import App from "./App";
   import { AuthController } from "./shared/AuthController";

   export default function Auth() {
     const [username, setUsername] = useState("");
     const [signedIn, setSignedIn] = useState(false);

     async function signIn(e: FormEvent) {
       e.preventDefault();
       try {
         remult.user = await AuthController.signIn(username);
         setSignedIn(true);
       } catch (error: unknown) {
         alert((error as { message: string }).message);
       }
     }

     async function signOut() {
       await AuthController.signOut();
       remult.user = undefined;
       setSignedIn(false);
     }
     useEffect(() => {
       remult.initUser().then(() => {
         setSignedIn(remult.authenticated());
       });
     }, []);

     if (!signedIn)
       return (
         <>
           <h1>Todos</h1>
           <main>
             <form onSubmit={signIn}>
               <input
                 value={username}
                 onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
                 placeholder="Username, try Steve or Jane"
               />
               <button>Sign in</button>
             </form>
           </main>
         </>
       );
     return (
       <>
         <header>
           Hello {remult.user!.name} <button onClick={signOut}>Sign Out</button>
         </header>
         <App />
       </>
     );
   }

   ```

2. In the `main.tsx` file, Replace the `App` component with the `Auth` component.

   ```ts{5,10}
   // src/main.tsx

   import React from "react"
   import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"
   import Auth from "./Auth"
   import "./index.css"

   ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
     <React.StrictMode>
       <Auth />
     </React.StrictMode>
   )
   ```

The todo app now supports signing in and out, with **all access restricted to signed in users only**.

## Role-based Authorization

Usually, not all application users have the same privileges. Let's define an `admin` role for our todo app, and enforce the following authorization rules:

- All signed in users can see the list of tasks.
- All signed in users can set specific tasks as `completed`.
- Only users belonging to the `admin` role can create, delete or edit the titles of tasks.

1. Modify the highlighted lines in the `Task` entity class to reflect the top three authorization rules.

```ts{7-8,18}
// src/shared/Task.ts

import { Allow, Entity, Fields, Validators } from "remult"

@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated,
  allowApiInsert: "admin",
  allowApiDelete: "admin"
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.uuid()
  id!: string

  @Fields.string({
    validate: (task) => {
      if (task.title.length < 3) throw "Too Short"
    }
    allowApiUpdate: "admin"
  })
  title = ""

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false
}
```

2. Let's give the user _"Jane"_ the `admin` role by modifying the `roles` array of her `validUsers` entry.

```ts{3,13}
// src/shared/AuthController.ts

const validUsers = [{ name: "Jane", admin: true }, { name: "Steve" }];

export class AuthController {
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async signIn(name: string) {
    const user = validUsers.find((user) => user.name === name);
    if (user) {
      remult.user = {
        id: user.name,
        name: user.name,
        roles: user.admin ? ["admin"] : [],
      };
      remult.context.request!.session!["user"] = remult.user;
      return remult.user;
    } else {
      throw Error("Invalid user, try 'Steve' or 'Jane'");
    }
  }
```

**Sign in to the app as _"Steve"_ to test that the actions restricted to `admin` users are not allowed. :lock:**

## Role-based Authorization on the Frontend

From a user experience perspective it only makes sense that users that can't add or delete, would not see these buttons.

Let's reuse the same definitions on the Frontend.

We'll use the entity's metadata to only show the form if the user is allowed to insert

```tsx{4,13}
// src/App.tsx

<main>
  {taskRepo.metadata.apiInsertAllowed() && (
    <form onSubmit={addTask}>
      <input
        value={newTaskTitle}
        placeholder="What needs to be done?"
        onChange={e => setNewTaskTitle(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button>Add</button>
    </form>
  )}
  ...
</main>
```

And let's do the same for the `delete` button:

```tsx{12,14}
// src/App.tsx

return (
  <div key={task.id}>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={task.completed}
      onChange={e => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
    />
    <input value={task.title} onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)} />
    <button onClick={saveTask}>Save</button>
    {taskRepo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(task) && (
      <button onClick={deleteTask}>Delete</button>
    )}
  </div>
)
```

This way we can keep the frontend consistent with the `api`'s Authorization rules

- Note We send the `task` to the `apiDeleteAllowed` method, because the `apiDeleteAllowed` option, can be sophisticated and can also be based on the specific item's values.



# react - Tutorial - Database

# Database

Up until now the todo app has been using a plain JSON file to store the list of tasks. **In production, we'd like to use a `Postgres` database table instead.**

::: tip Learn more
See the [Quickstart](https://remult.dev/docs/quickstart.html#connecting-a-database) article for the (long) list of relational and non-relational databases Remult supports.
:::

::: warning Don't have Postgres installed? Don't have to.
Don't worry if you don't have Postgres installed locally. In the next step of the tutorial, we'll configure the app to use Postgres in production, and keep using JSON files in our dev environment.

**Simply install `postgres-node` per step 1 below and move on to the [Deployment section of the tutorial](deployment.md).**
:::

1. Install `postgres-node` ("pg").

   ```sh
   npm i pg
   ```

2. Add the highlighted code to the `api` server module.

   ```ts{5,9-11}
   // src/server/api.ts

   //...

   import { createPostgresDataProvider } from "remult/postgres"

   export const api = remultExpress({
     //...
     dataProvider: createPostgresDataProvider({
       connectionString: "your connection string"
     })
   })
   ```



# react - Tutorial - Deployment

# Deployment

Let's deploy the todo app to [railway.app](https://railway.app/).

## Prepare for Production

In this tutorial, we'll deploy both the React app and the API server as [one server-side app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#other-solutions), and redirect all non-API requests to return the React app.

We will deploy an ESM node server project

In addition, to follow a few basic production best practices, we'll use [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) middleware to improve performance and [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) middleware for security

1. Add the highlighted code lines to `src/server/index.ts`, and modify the `app.listen` function's `port` argument to prefer a port number provided by the production host's `PORT` environment variable.

```ts{16-21}
// src/server/index.ts

import express from "express"
import { api } from "./api.js"
import session from "cookie-session"
import { auth } from "./auth.js"

const app = express()
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env["SESSION_SECRET"] || "my secret"
  })
)
app.use(auth)
app.use(api)
const frontendFiles = process.cwd() + "/dist";
app.use(express.static(frontendFiles));
app.get("/*", (_, res) => {
  res.sendFile(frontendFiles + "/index.html");
});
app.listen(process.env["PORT"] || 3002, () => console.log("Server started"));
```

3. Modify the highlighted code in the api server module to prefer a `connectionString` provided by the production host's `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

   ```ts{4,7-9}
   // src/server/api.ts

   //...
   const DATABASE_URL = process.env["DATABASE_URL"];

   export const api = remultExpress({
    dataProvider: DATABASE_URL
      ? createPostgresDataProvider({ connectionString: DATABASE_URL })
      : undefined,
      //...
    })
   ```

::: warning Note
In order to connect to a local PostgresDB, add `DATABASE_URL` to an .env file, or simply replace `process.env["DATABASE_URL"]` with your `connectionString`.

If no `DATABASE_URL` has found, it'll fallback to our local JSON files.
:::

4. Modify the project's `build` npm script to additionally transpile the API server's TypeScript code to JavaScript (using `tsc`).

```json
// package.json

"build": "tsc && vite build && tsc -p tsconfig.server.json",
```

5. Modify the project's `start` npm script to start the production Node.js server.

```json
// package.json

"start": "node dist/server/"
```

The todo app is now ready for deployment to production.

## Test Locally

To test the application locally run

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

::: warning Build Errors
If you get an error `error TS5096: Option 'allowImportingTsExtensions' can only be used when either 'noEmit' or 'emitDeclarationOnly' is set.` do not set the `emitDeclarationOnly` flag!

You are getting the error because somewhere in your code you've imported from `.ts` instead of `.js` - fix it and build again
:::

Now navigate to http://localhost:3002 and test the application locally

## Deploy to Railway

In order to deploy the todo app to [railway](https://railway.app/) you'll need a `railway` account. You'll also need [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli#npm) installed, and you'll need to login to railway from the cli, using `railway login`.

Click enter multiple times to answer all its questions with the default answer

1. Create a Railway `project`.

   From the terminal in your project folder run:

   ```sh
   railway init
   ```

2. Set a project name.
3. Once that's done run the following command to open the project on railway.dev:
   ```sh
   railway open
   ```
4. Once that's done run the following command to upload the project to railway:
   ```sh
   railway up
   ```
5. Add Postgres Database:
   1. In the project on `railway.dev`, click `+ Create`
   2. Select `Database`
   3. Select `Add PostgresSQL`
6. Configure the environment variables
   1. Click on the project card (not the Postgres one)
   2. Switch to the `variables` tab
   3. Click on `+ New Variable`, and in the `VARIABLE_NAME` click `Add Reference` and select `DATABASE_URL`
   4. Add another variable called `SESSION_SECRET` and set it to a random string, you can use an [online UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)
   5. Switch to the `settings` tab
   6. Under `Environment` click on `Generate Domain`
   7. Click on the `Deploy` button on the top left.
7. Once the deployment is complete -
8. Click on the newly generated url to open the app in the browser and you'll see the app live in production. (it may take a few minutes to go live)

::: warning Note
If you run into trouble deploying the app to Railway, try using Railway's [documentation](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/deployments).

# angular - Tutorial - Setup

# Build a Full-Stack Angular Application

### Create a simple todo app with Remult using an Angular frontend

In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple app to manage a task list. We'll use `Angular` for the UI, `Node.js` + `Express.js` for the API server, and Remult as our full-stack CRUD framework. For deployment to production, we'll use [railway.app](https://railway.app/) and a `PostgreSQL` database.

By the end of the tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Remult and how to use it to accelerate and simplify full stack app development.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with `TypeScript` and `Angular`.

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. <!-- consider specifying Node minimum version with npm -->

If Angular CLI is not already installed - then install it.

```sh
npm i -g @angular/cli
```

# Setup for the Tutorial

This tutorial requires setting up an Angular project, an API server project, and a few lines of code to add Remult.

You can either **use a starter project** to speed things up, or go through the **step-by-step setup**.

## Option 1: Clone the Starter Project

1. Clone the _angular-express-starter_ repository from GitHub and install its dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/remult/angular-express-starter.git remult-angular-todo
cd remult-angular-todo
npm install
```

2. Open your IDE.
3. Open a terminal and run the `dev` npm script.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The default Angular app main screen should be displayed.

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.

## Option 2: Step-by-step Setup

### Create an Angular project

Create the new Angular project.

```sh
ng new remult-angular-todo
```

::: warning Note
The `ng new` command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app project. Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key.
:::

In this tutorial, we'll be using the root folder created by `Angular` as the root folder for our server project as well.

```sh
cd remult-angular-todo
```

### Install required packages

We need `Express` to serve our app's API, and, of course, `Remult`. For development, we'll use [tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) to run the API server.

```sh
npm i express remult
npm i --save-dev @types/express tsx
```

### Create the API server project

The starter API server TypeScript project contains a single module that initializes `Express`, and begins listening for API requests.

1. Open your IDE.

2. Add the following entry to the `compilerOptions` section of the `tsconfig.json` file to enable the use of Synthetic Default Imports.

```json{7-8}
// tsconfig.json

{
...
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
   ...
  }
...
}

```

2. Create a `server` folder under the `src/` folder created by Angular cli.

3. Create an `index.ts` file in the `src/server/` folder with the following code:

```ts
// src/server/index.ts

import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.listen(3002, () => console.log('Server started'))
```

### Bootstrap Remult in the back-end

Remult is loaded in the back-end as an `Express middleware`.

1. Create an `api.ts` file in the `src/server/` folder with the following code:

```ts
// src/server/api.ts

import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'

export const api = remultExpress()
```

2. Add the highlighted code lines to register the middleware in the main server module `index.ts`.

```ts{4,7}
// src/server/index.ts

import express from "express"
import { api } from "./api"

const app = express()
app.use(api)

app.listen(3002, () => console.log("Server started"))
```

### Final tweaks

Our full stack starter project is almost ready. Let's complete these final configurations.

#### Proxy API requests from Angular DevServer to the API server

The Angular app created in this tutorial is intended to be served from the same domain as its API.
However, for development, the API server will be listening on `http://localhost:3002`, while the Angular dev server is served from the default `http://localhost:4200`.

We'll use the [proxy](https://angular.io/guide/build#proxying-to-a-backend-server) feature of Angular dev server to divert all calls for `http://localhost:4200/api` to our dev API server.

Create a file `proxy.conf.json` in the root folder, with the following contents:

```json
// proxy.conf.json

{
  "/api": {
    "target": "http://localhost:3002",
    "secure": false
  }
}
```

### Run the app

1. Add a script called `dev` that will run the angular `dev` server with the proxy configuration we've set and a script called `dev-node` to run the api.

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "dev": "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json --open",
  "dev-node": "tsx watch src/server",
  ...
}
```

1. Open a terminal and start the angular dev server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

3. Open another terminal and start the `node` server

```sh
npm run dev-node
```

The server is now running and listening on port 3002. `tsx` is watching for file changes and will restart the server when code changes are saved.

The default Angular app main screen should be displayed on the regular port - 4200. Open it in the browser at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).

### Remove Angular default styles

The angular default styles won't fit our todo app. If you'd like a nice-looking app, replace the contents of `src/styles.css` with [this CSS file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remult/angular-express-starter/master/src/styles.css). Otherwise, you can simply **delete the contents of `src/styles.css`**.

### Setup completed

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.



# angular - Tutorial - Entities

# Entities

Let's start coding the app by defining the `Task` entity class.

The `Task` entity class will be used:

- As a model class for client-side code
- As a model class for server-side code
- By `remult` to generate API endpoints, API queries, and database commands

The `Task` entity class we're creating will have an auto-generated `id` field, a `title` field, a `completed` field and an auto-generated `createdAt` field. The entity's API route ("tasks") will include endpoints for all `CRUD` operations.

## Define the Model

1. Create a `shared` folder under the `src` folder. This folder will contain code shared between frontend and backend.

2. Create a file `Task.ts` in the `src/shared/` folder, with the following code:

```ts
// src/shared/Task.ts

import { Entity, Fields } from 'remult'

@Entity('tasks', {
  allowApiCrud: true,
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''

  @Fields.string()
  title = ''

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false

  @Fields.createdAt()
  createdAt?: Date
}
```

3. In the server's `api` module, register the `Task` entity with Remult by adding `entities: [Task]` to an `options` object you pass to the `remultExpress()` middleware:

```ts{4,7}
// src/server/api.ts

import { remultExpress } from "remult/remult-express"
import { Task } from "../shared/Task"

export const api = remultExpress({
  entities: [Task]
})
```

The [@Entity](../../docs/ref_entity.md) decorator tells Remult this class is an entity class. The decorator accepts a `key` argument (used to name the API route and as a default database collection/table name), and an `options` argument used to define entity-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial.

To initially allow all CRUD operations for tasks, we set the option [allowApiCrud](../../docs/ref_entity.md#allowapicrud) to `true`.

The [@Fields.cuid](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-cuid) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a short random id using the [cuid](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid) library. This value can't be changed after the entity is created.

The [@Fields.string](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-string) decorator tells Remult the `title` property is an entity data field of type `String`. This decorator is also used to define field-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial and the same goes for `@Fields.boolean` and the `completed` property.

The [@Fields.createdAt](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-createdat) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a `createdAt` field with the current date and time.

::: tip
For a complete list of supported field types, see the [Field Types](../../docs/field-types.md) section in the Remult documentation.
:::

## Test the API

Now that the `Task` entity is defined, we can start using the REST API to query and add a tasks.

1. Open a browser with the url: [http://localhost:3002/api/tasks](http://localhost:3002/api/tasks), and you'll see that you get an empty array.

2. Use `curl` to `POST` a new task - _Clean car_.

```sh
curl http://localhost:3002/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"Clean car\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

3. Refresh the browser for the url: [http://localhost:3002/api/tasks](http://localhost:3002/api/tasks) and see that the array now contains one item.

4. Use `curl` to `POST` a few more tasks:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3002/api/tasks -d "[{\"title\": \"Read a book\"},{\"title\": \"Take a nap\", \"completed\":true },{\"title\": \"Pay bills\"},{\"title\": \"Do laundry\"}]" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

- Note that the `POST` endpoint can accept a single `Task` or an array of `Task`s.

5. Refresh the browser again, to see that the tasks were stored in the db.

::: warning Wait, where is the backend database?
While remult supports [many relational and non-relational databases](https://remult.dev/docs/databases.html), in this tutorial we start by storing entity data in a backend **JSON file**. Notice that a `db` folder has been created under the root folder, with a `tasks.json` file containing the created tasks.
:::

## Admin UI

### Enabling the Admin UI

Add the Admin UI to your Angular application by setting the `admin` option to `true` in the `remultExpress()`

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import { Task } from '../shared/Task.js'

export const api = remultExpress({
  entities: [Task],
  admin: true, // Enable the Admin UI
})
```

:::

### Accessing and Using the Admin UI

Navigate to `http://localhost:3002/api/admin` to access the Admin UI. Here, you can perform CRUD operations on your entities, view their relationships via the Diagram entry, and ensure secure management with the same validations and authorizations as your application.

![Remult Admin](/remult-admin.png)

### Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Directly create, update, and delete tasks through the Admin UI.
- **Entity Diagram**: Visualize relationships between entities for better data structure understanding.
- **Security**: Operations are secure, adhering to application-defined rules.

## Display the Task List

Let's start developing the web app by displaying the list of existing tasks in an Angular component.

1. Create a `Todo` component using Angular's cli

   ```sh
   ng g c todo
   ```

2. Import the new component in the `app.component.ts`

   ```ts{8,18}
   //src/app/app.component.ts

   import { Component } from '@angular/core';
   import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
   import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';
   import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
   import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
   import { TodoComponent } from './todo/todo.component';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-root',
     standalone: true,
     imports: [
       CommonModule,
       RouterOutlet,
       HttpClientModule,
       FormsModule,
       TodoComponent,
     ],
     templateUrl: './app.component.html',
     styleUrl: './app.component.css',
   })
   export class AppComponent {
     title = 'remult-angular-todo';
   }

   ```

3. Replace the `app.components.html` to use the `todo` component.

   ```html
   <!-- src/app/app.component.html -->

   <app-todo></app-todo>
   ```

4. Add the highlighted code lines to the `TodoComponent` class file:

   ```ts{5-7,12,,17-21}
   // src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

   import { Component } from '@angular/core';
   import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
   import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
   import { remult } from 'remult';
   import { Task } from '../../shared/Task';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-todo',
     standalone: true,
     imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule],
     templateUrl: './todo.component.html',
     styleUrl: './todo.component.css',
   })
   export class TodoComponent {
     taskRepo = remult.repo(Task);
     tasks: Task[] = [];
     ngOnInit() {
       this.taskRepo.find().then((items) => (this.tasks = items));
     }
   }
   ```

   Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet:

   - We've imported the `FormsModule` for angular's forms support
   - `taskRepo` is a Remult [Repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md) object used to fetch and create Task entity objects.
   - `tasks` is a Task array.
   - The `ngOnInit` method calls theRemult [repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md)'s [find](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method to fetch tasks from the server, once when the component is loaded.

5. Replace the contents of `todo.component.html` with the following HTML:

   ```html
   <!-- src/app/todo/todo.component.html -->

   <h1>todos</h1>
   <main>
     <div *ngFor="let task of tasks">
       <input type="checkbox" [(ngModel)]="task.completed" />
       {{task.title}}
     </div>
   </main>
   ```

After the browser refreshes, the list of tasks appears.



# angular - Tutorial - Paging, Sorting and Filtering

# Paging, Sorting and Filtering

The RESTful API created by Remult supports **server-side paging, sorting, and filtering**. Let's use that to limit, sort and filter the list of tasks.

## Limit Number of Fetched Tasks

Since our database may eventually contain a lot of tasks, it make sense to use a **paging strategy** to limit the number of tasks retrieved in a single fetch from the back-end database.

Let's limit the number of fetched tasks to `20`.

In the `ngOnInit` method, pass an `options` argument to the `find` method call and set its `limit` property to 20.

```ts{5}
// src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

ngOnInit() {
  this.taskRepo.find({
    limit: 20
  }).then((items) => (this.tasks = items));
}
```

There aren't enough tasks in the database for this change to have an immediate effect, but it will have one later on when we'll add more tasks.

::: tip
To query subsequent pages, use the [Repository.find()](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method's `page` option.
:::

## Sorting By Creation Date

We would like old tasks to appear first in the list, and new tasks to appear last. Let's sort the tasks by their `createdAt` field.

In the `ngOnInit` method, set the `orderBy` property of the `find` method call's `option` argument to an object that contains the fields you want to sort by.
Use "asc" and "desc" to determine the sort order.

```ts{6}
// src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

ngOnInit() {
  this.taskRepo.find({
    limit: 20,
    orderBy: { createdAt:"asc" }
  }).then((items) => (this.tasks = items));
}
```

## Server side Filtering

Remult supports sending filter rules to the server to query only the tasks that we need.

Adjust the `ngOnInit` method to fetch only `completed` tasks.

```ts{7}
// src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

ngOnInit() {
  this.taskRepo.find({
    limit: 20,
    orderBy: { createdAt:"asc" },
    where: { completed: true }
  }).then((items) => (this.tasks = items));
}
```

::: warning Note
Because the `completed` field is of type `boolean`, the argument is **compile-time checked to be of the `boolean` type**. Settings the `completed` filter to `undefined` causes it to be ignored by Remult.
:::

Play with different filtering values, and eventually comment it out, since we do need all the tasks

```ts{5}
ngOnInit() {
  this.taskRepo.find({
    limit: 20,
    orderBy: { createdAt:"asc" },
    //where: { completed: true }
  }).then((items) => (this.tasks = items));
}
```

::: tip Learn more
Explore the reference for a [comprehensive list of filtering options](../../docs/entityFilter.md).
:::



# angular - Tutorial - CRUD Operations

# CRUD Operations

## Adding new tasks

Now that we can see the list of tasks, it's time to add a few more.

1. Add a `newTaskTitle` field and an `addTask` method to the `ToDoComponent`

```ts{4-13}
// src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

export class TodoComponent implements OnInit {
  newTaskTitle = ""
  async addTask() {
    try {
      const newTask = await this.taskRepo.insert({ title: this.newTaskTitle })
      this.tasks.push(newTask)
      this.newTaskTitle = ""
    } catch (error: any) {
      alert(error.message)
    }
  }
}
```

- the call to `taskRepo.insert` will make a post request to the server, insert the new task to the `db`, and return the new `Task` object with all it's info (including the id generated by the database)

2. Add an _Add Task_ form in the html template:

```html{5-12}
<!-- src/app/todo/todo.component.html -->

<h1>todos</h1>
<main>
  <form (submit)="addTask()">
    <input
      placeholder="What needs to be done?"
      [(ngModel)]="newTaskTitle"
      name="newTaskTitle"
    />
    <button>Add</button>
  </form>
  <div *ngFor="let task of tasks">
    <input type="checkbox" [(ngModel)]="task.completed" />
    {{ task.title }}
  </div>
</main>
```

Try adding a few tasks to see how it works

## Rename Tasks and Mark as Completed

To make the tasks in the list updatable, we'll bind the `input` elements to the `Task` properties and add a _Save_ button to save the changes to the backend database.

1. Add a `saveTask` method to save the state of a task to the backend database

   ```ts
   // src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

   async saveTask(task: Task) {
     try {
       await this.taskRepo.save(task)
     } catch (error: any) {
       alert(error.message)
     }
   }
   ```

2) Modify the contents of the `tasks` div to include the following `input` elements and a _Save_ button to call the `saveTask` method.

   ```html{4-10}
   <!-- src/app/todo/todo.component.html -->

   <div *ngFor="let task of tasks">
     <input
       type="checkbox"
       [(ngModel)]="task.completed"
       (change)="saveTask(task)"
     />
     <input [(ngModel)]="task.title" />
     <button (click)="saveTask(task)">Save</button>
   </div>
   ```

Make some changes and refresh the browser to verify the backend database is updated.

## Delete Tasks

Let's add a _Delete_ button next to the _Save_ button of each task in the list.

1. Add the following `deleteTask` method to the `TodoComponent` class:

```ts
// src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

async deleteTask(task: Task) {
   await this.taskRepo.delete(task);
   this.tasks = this.tasks.filter(t => t !== task);
}
```

2. Add a _Delete_ button in the html:

```html{11}
<!-- src/app/todo/todo.component.html -->

<div *ngFor="let task of tasks">
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    [(ngModel)]="task.completed"
    (change)="saveTask(task)"
  />
  <input [(ngModel)]="task.title" />
  <button (click)="saveTask(task)">Save</button>
  <button (click)="deleteTask(task)">Delete</button>
</div>
```



# angular - Tutorial - Validation

# Validation

Validating user entered data is usually required both on the client-side and on the server-side, often causing a violation of the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) design principle. **With Remult, validation code can be placed within the entity class, and Remult will run the validation logic on both the frontend and the relevant API requests.**

::: warning Handling validation errors

When a validation error occurs, Remult will throw an exception. 

In this tutorial, [CRUD operations](crud.md) catch these exceptions, and alert the user.
We leave it to you to decide how to handle validation errors in your application.
:::

## Validate the Title Field

Task titles are required. Let's add a validity check for this rule.

1. In the `Task` entity class, modify the `Fields.string` decorator for the `title` field to include an object literal argument and set the object's `validate` property to `Validators.required`.

```ts{3-5}
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Fields.string({
  validate: Validators.required
})
title = ""
```

::: warning Import Validators
This code requires adding an import of `Validators` from `remult`.
:::

::: warning Manual browser refresh required
For this change to take effect, you **must manually refresh the browser**.
:::

After the browser is refreshed, try creating a new `task` or saving an existing one with an empty title - the _"Should not be empty"_ error message is displayed.

### Implicit server-side validation

The validation code we've added is called by Remult on the server-side to validate any API calls attempting to modify the `title` field.

Try making the following `POST` http request to the `http://localhost:3002/api/tasks` API route, providing an invalid title.

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3002/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

An http error is returned and the validation error text is included in the response body,

## Custom Validation

The `validate` property of the first argument of `Remult` field decorators can be set to an arrow function which will be called to validate input on both front-end and back-end.

Try something like this and see what happens:

```ts
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Fields.string<Task>({
  validate: (task) => {
    if (task.title.length < 3) throw "Too Short"
  }
})
title = ""
```



# angular - Tutorial - Live Queries

# Live Queries

Our todo list app can have multiple users using it at the same time. However, changes made by one user are not seen by others unless they manually refresh the browser.

Let's add realtime multiplayer capabilities to this app.

## One Time Setup

We'll need angular to run it's change detection when we receive messages from the backend - to do that we'll add the following code to `AppComponent`

```ts{3-5,7-9}
// src/app/app.component.ts

import { Component, NgZone } from '@angular/core';
import { remult } from "remult"
//...
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(zone: NgZone) {
    remult.apiClient.wrapMessageHandling = handler => zone.run(() => handler())
  }
}
```

## Realtime updated todo list

Let's switch from fetching Tasks once when the Angular component is loaded, and manually maintaining state for CRUD operations, to using a realtime updated live query subscription **for both initial data fetching and subsequent state changes**.

1. Modify the contents of the `ngOnInit` method in the `Todo` component:

Modify the `TodoComponent` with the following changes

```ts{3,5,9,11-12,17,19-21}
// src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

import { Component, OnDestroy, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
...
export class TodoComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  //...
  taskRepo = remult.repo(Task)
  tasks: Task[] = []
  unsubscribe = () => {}
  ngOnInit() {
    this.unsubscribe = this.taskRepo
      .liveQuery({
        limit: 20,
        orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
        //where: { completed: true },
      })
      .subscribe(info => (this.tasks = info.applyChanges(this.tasks)))
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.unsubscribe()
  }
}
```

Let's review the change:

- Instead of calling the `repository`'s `find` method we now call the `liveQuery` method to define the query, and then call its `subscribe` method to establish a subscription which will update the Tasks state in realtime.
- The `subscribe` method accepts a callback with an `info` object that has 3 members:
  - `items` - an up to date list of items representing the current result - it's useful for readonly use cases.
  - `applyChanges` - a method that receives an array and applies the changes to it - we send that method to the `setTasks` state function, to apply the changes to the existing `tasks` state.
  - `changes` - a detailed list of changes that were received
- The `subscribe` method returns an `unsubscribe` method, which we store in the `unsubscribe` member and call in the `ngOnDestroy` hook, so that it'll be called when the component unmounts.

2. As all relevant CRUD operations (made by all users) will **immediately update the component's state**, we should remove the manual adding of new Tasks to the component's state:

```ts{6}
// src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

async addTask() {
  try {
    const newTask = await this.taskRepo.insert({ title: this.newTaskTitle })
    //this.tasks.push(newTask) <-- this line is no longer needed
    this.newTaskTitle = ""
  } catch (error: any) {
    alert(error.message)
  }
}
```

3. Optionally remove other redundant state changing code:

```ts{5}
// src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

async deleteTask(task: Task) {
   await this.taskRepo.delete(task);
   // this.tasks = this.tasks.filter(t => t !== task); <-- this line is no longer needed
}
```

Open the todo app in two (or more) browser windows/tabs, make some changes in one window and notice how the others are updated in realtime.

::: tip Under the hood
The default implementation of live-queries uses HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push realtime updates to clients, and stores live-query information in-memory.

For serverless environments _(or multi servers)_, live-query updates can be pushed using integration with third-party realtime providers, such as [Ably](https://ably.com/) (or others), and live-query information can be stored to any database supported by Remult.
:::



# angular - Tutorial - Backend methods

# Backend methods

When performing operations on multiple entity objects, performance considerations may necessitate running them on the server. **With Remult, moving client-side logic to run on the server is a simple refactoring**.

## Set All Tasks as Un/completed

Let's add two buttons to the todo app: "Set all as completed" and "Set all as uncompleted".

1. Add a `setAllCompleted` async method to the `TodoComponent` class, which accepts a `completed` boolean argument and sets the value of the `completed` field of all the tasks accordingly.

   ```ts
   // src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

   async setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
     for (const task of await this.taskRepo.find()) {
       await this.taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed });
     }
   }
   ```

   The `for` loop iterates the array of `Task` objects returned from the backend, and saves each task back to the backend with a modified value in the `completed` field.

2. Add the two buttons to the `TodoComponent` just before the closing `</main>` tag. Both of the buttons' `click` events will call the `setAllCompleted` method with the appropriate value of the `completed` argument.

   ```html
   <!-- src/app/todo/todo.component.html -->

   <div>
     <button (click)="setAllCompleted(true)">Set all as completed</button>
     <button (click)="setAllCompleted(false)">Set all as uncompleted</button>
   </div>
   ```

Make sure the buttons are working as expected before moving on to the next step.

## Refactor from Front-end to Back-end

With the current state of the `setAllCompleted` function, each modified task being saved causes an API `PUT` request handled separately by the server. As the number of tasks in the todo list grows, this may become a performance issue.

A simple way to prevent this is to expose an API endpoint for `setAllCompleted` requests, and run the same logic on the server instead of the client.

1. Create a new `TasksController` class, in the `shared` folder, and refactor the `for` loop from the `setAllCompleted` method of the `TodoComponent`into a new, `static`, `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController` class, which will run on the server.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

import { BackendMethod, remult } from 'remult'
import { Task } from './Task'

export class TasksController {
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
    const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task)

    for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
      await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
    }
  }
}
```

The `@BackendMethod` decorator tells Remult to expose the method as an API endpoint (the `allowed` property will be discussed later on in this tutorial).

**Unlike the front-end `Remult` object, the server implementation interacts directly with the database.**

2. Register `TasksController` by adding it to the `controllers` array of the `options` object passed to `remultExpress()`, in the server's `api` module:

```ts{4,8}
// src/server/api.ts

//...
import { TasksController } from "../shared/TasksController"

export const api = remultExpress({
  //...
  controllers: [TasksController]
})
```

3. Replace the `for` iteration in the `setAllCompleted` function of the `App` component with a call to the `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController`.

```ts{4}
// src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

async setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
  await TasksController.setAllCompleted(completed);
}
```

::: warning Import TasksController
Remember to add an import of `TasksController` in `todo.component.ts`.
:::

::: tip Note
With Remult backend methods, argument types are compile-time checked. :thumbsup:
:::

After the browser refreshed, the _"Set all..."_ buttons function exactly the same, but much faster.



# angular - Tutorial - Authentication and Authorization

# Authentication and Authorization

Our todo app is nearly functionally complete, but it still doesn't fulfill a very basic requirement - that users should log in before they can view, create or modify tasks.

Remult provides a flexible mechanism that enables placing **code-based authorization rules** at various levels of the application's API. To maintain high code cohesion, **entity and field-level authorization code should be placed in entity classes**.

**Remult is completely unopinionated when it comes to user authentication.** You are free to use any kind of authentication mechanism, and only required to provide Remult with an object which implements the Remult `UserInfo` interface.

In this tutorial, we'll use `Express`'s [cookie-session](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-session.html) middleware to store an authenticated user's session within a cookie. The `user` property of the session will be set by the API server upon a successful simplistic sign-in (based on username without password).

## Tasks CRUD Requires Sign-in

This rule is implemented within the `Task` `@Entity` decorator, by modifying the value of the `allowApiCrud` property.
This property can be set to a function that accepts a `Remult` argument and returns a `boolean` value. Let's use the `Allow.authenticated` function from Remult.

```ts{4}
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Entity("tasks", {
    allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated
})
```

::: warning Import Allow
This code requires adding an import of `Allow` from `remult`.
:::

After the browser refreshes, **the list of tasks disappeared** and the user can no longer create new tasks.

::: details Inspect the HTTP error returned by the API using cURL

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3002/api/tasks
```

:::

::: danger Authorized server-side code can still modify tasks
Although client CRUD requests to `tasks` API endpoints now require a signed-in user, the API endpoint created for our `setAllCompleted` server function remains available to unauthenticated requests. Since the `allowApiCrud` rule we implemented does not affect the server-side code's ability to use the `Task` entity class for performing database CRUD operations, **the `setAllCompleted` function still works as before**.

To fix this, let's implement the same rule using the `@BackendMethod` decorator of the `setAllCompleted` method of `TasksController`.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

@BackendMethod({ allowed: Allow.authenticated })
```

**This code requires adding an import of `Allow` from `remult`.**
:::

## User Authentication

Let's add a sign-in area to the todo app, with an `input` for typing in a `username` and a sign-in `button`. The app will have two valid `username` values - _"Jane"_ and _"Steve"_. After a successful sign-in, the sign-in area will be replaced by a "Hi [username]" message.

### Backend setup

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to install the required packages:

```sh
npm i cookie-session
npm i --save-dev @types/cookie-session
```

2. Modify the main server module `index.ts` to use the `cookie-session` Express middleware.

   ```ts{5,8-12}
   // src/server/index.ts

   //...

   import session from "cookie-session"

   const app = express()
   app.use(
     session({
       secret: process.env["SESSION_SECRET"] || "my secret"
     })
   )

   //...
   ```

   The `cookie-session` middleware stores session data, digitally signed using the value of the `secret` property, in an `httpOnly` cookie, sent by the browser to all subsequent API requests.

3. add a `shared/AuthController.ts` file and include the following code:

   ```ts add={4-6,8-12}
   // src/shared/AuthController.ts

   import { BackendMethod, remult } from 'remult'
   import type express from 'express'
   // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
   import type from 'cookie-session' // required to access the session member of the request object

   declare module 'remult' {
     export interface RemultContext {
       request?: express.Request
     }
   }

   export class AuthController {
     //
   }
   ```

   ### Code Explanation

   - We import the necessary modules from `remult` and types for `express` and `cookie-session`.
   - We extend the `RemultContext` interface to include an optional `request` property of type `express.Request`.
   - Remult will automatically set the `request` with the current request. Since Remult works with any server framework, we need to type it to the correct server, which in this case is Express. This typing gives us access to the request object and its session, managed by `cookie-session`.
   - This `request` can be accessed using `remult.context.request`.

   Next, we'll add a static list of users and a sign-in method. (In a real application, you would use a database, but for this tutorial, a static list will suffice.)

   ```ts add={1,4-17}
   const validUsers = [{ name: 'Jane' }, { name: 'Alex' }]

   export class AuthController {
     @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
     static async signIn(name: string) {
       const user = validUsers.find((user) => user.name === name)
       if (user) {
         remult.user = {
           id: user.name,
           name: user.name,
         }
         remult.context.request!.session!['user'] = remult.user
         return remult.user
       } else {
         throw Error("Invalid user, try 'Alex' or 'Jane'")
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   ### Code Explanation

   - We define a static list of valid users.
   - The `signIn` method is decorated with `@BackendMethod({ allowed: true })`, making it accessible from the frontend.
   - The method checks if the provided `name` exists in the `validUsers` list. If it does, it sets `remult.user` to an object that conforms to the `UserInfo` type from Remult and stores this user in the request session.
   - If the user is not found, it throws an error.

   Next, we'll add the sign-out method:

   ```ts add={7-11}
   export class AuthController {
     @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
     static async signIn(name: string) {
       //...
     }

     @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
     static async signOut() {
       remult.context.request!.session!['user'] = undefined
       return undefined
     }
   }
   ```

   - The `signOut` method clears the user session, making the user unauthenticated.

4. Update `remultExpress` configuration.

   ```ts{3,5,6}
   // src/server/api.ts

   import { AuthController } from '../shared/AuthController.js'

   export const api = remultExpress({
     //...
     controllers: [TaskController, AuthController]
     getUser: (req) => req.session!['user'],
   })
   ```

   ### Code Explanation

   - Register the `AuthController` so that the frontend can call its `signIn` and `signOut` methods
   - `getUser` function: The getUser function is responsible for extracting the user information from the session. If a user is found in the session, Remult will treat the request as authenticated, and this user will be used for authorization purposes.

### Frontend setup

1. Create an `Auth` component using Angular's cli
   ```sh
   ng g c auth
   ```
2. Add the highlighted code lines to the `AuthComponent` class file:

   ```ts
   // src/app/auth/auth.component.ts

   import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'
   import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common'
   import { UserInfo, remult } from 'remult'
   import { HttpClient, HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'
   import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'
   import { TodoComponent } from '../todo/todo.component'

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-auth',
     standalone: true,
     imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule, TodoComponent, HttpClientModule],
     templateUrl: './auth.component.html',
     styleUrl: './auth.component.css',
   })
   export class AuthComponent implements OnInit {
     signInUsername = ''
     remult = remult

     async signIn() {
       try {
         remult.user = await AuthController.signIn(this.signInUsername)
       } catch (error: unknown) {
         alert((error as { message: string }).message)
       }
     }

     async signOut() {
       await AuthController.signOut()
       remult.user = undefined
     }

     ngOnInit() {
       remult.initUser()
     }
   }
   ```

3. Replace the contents of auth.component.html with the following html:

   ```html
   <!-- src/app/auth/auth.component.html -->

   <ng-container *ngIf="!remult.authenticated()">
     <h1>todos</h1>
     <main>
       <form (submit)="signIn()">
         <input
           [(ngModel)]="signInUsername"
           placeholder="Username, try Steve or Jane"
           name="username"
         />
         <button>Sign in</button>
       </form>
     </main>
   </ng-container>
   <ng-container *ngIf="remult.authenticated()">
     <header>
       Hello {{ remult.user?.name }}
       <button (click)="signOut()">Sign Out</button>
     </header>
     <app-todo></app-todo>
   </ng-container>
   ```

4. Replace the `TodoComponent` with the `AuthComponent` in the `AppComponent`

   ```ts{6,12}
   //src/app/app.component.ts

   import { Component, NgZone } from '@angular/core';
   import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
   import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';
   import { AuthComponent } from './auth/auth.component';
   import { remult } from 'remult';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-root',
     standalone: true,
     imports: [CommonModule, RouterOutlet, AuthComponent],
     templateUrl: './app.component.html',
     styleUrl: './app.component.css',
   })

   ```

5. Change the `app.component.html` to use the `AuthComponent` instead of the `TodoComponent`

   ```html
   <!-- src/app/app.component.html -->

   <app-auth></app-auth>
   ```

The todo app now supports signing in and out, with **all access restricted to signed in users only**.

## Role-based Authorization

Usually, not all application users have the same privileges. Let's define an `admin` role for our todo app, and enforce the following authorization rules:

- All signed in users can see the list of tasks.
- All signed in users can set specific tasks as `completed`.
- Only users belonging to the `admin` role can create, delete or edit the titles of tasks.

1. Modify the highlighted lines in the `Task` entity class to reflect the top three authorization rules.

```ts{7-8,18}
// src/shared/Task.ts

import { Allow, Entity, Fields, Validators } from "remult"

@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated,
  allowApiInsert: "admin",
  allowApiDelete: "admin"
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.uuid()
  id!: string

  @Fields.string({
    validate: (task) => {
      if (task.title.length < 3) throw "Too Short"
    }
    allowApiUpdate: "admin"
  })
  title = ""

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false
}
```

2. Let's give the user _"Jane"_ the `admin` role by modifying the `roles` array of her `validUsers` entry.

```ts{3,13}
// src/shared/AuthController.ts

const validUsers = [{ name: "Jane", admin: true }, { name: "Steve" }];

export class AuthController {
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async signIn(name: string) {
    const user = validUsers.find((user) => user.name === name);
    if (user) {
      remult.user = {
        id: user.name,
        name: user.name,
        roles: user.admin ? ["admin"] : [],
      };
      remult.context.request!.session!["user"] = remult.user;
      return remult.user;
    } else {
      throw Error("Invalid user, try 'Steve' or 'Jane'");
    }
  }
```

**Sign in to the app as _"Steve"_ to test that the actions restricted to `admin` users are not allowed. :lock:**

## Role-based Authorization on the Frontend

From a user experience perspective it only makes sense that users that can't add or delete, would not see these buttons.

Let's reuse the same definitions on the Frontend.

Modify the contents of todo.component.html to only display the form and delete buttons if these operations are allowed based on the entity's metadata:

```html{5,22}
<!-- src/app/todo/todo.component.html -->

<h1>todos</h1>
<main>
  <form *ngIf="taskRepo.metadata.apiInsertAllowed()" (submit)="addTask()">
    <input
      placeholder="What needs to be done?"
      [(ngModel)]="newTaskTitle"
      name="newTaskTitle"
    />
    <button>Add</button>
  </form>
  <div *ngFor="let task of tasks">
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      [(ngModel)]="task.completed"
      (change)="saveTask(task)"
    />
    <input [(ngModel)]="task.title" />
    <button (click)="saveTask(task)">Save</button>
    <button
      *ngIf="taskRepo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(task)"
      (click)="deleteTask(task)"
    >
      Delete
    </button>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button (click)="setAllCompleted(true)">Set all as completed</button>
    <button (click)="setAllCompleted(false)">Set all as uncompleted</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

This way we can keep the frontend consistent with the `api`'s Authorization rules

- Note We send the `task` to the `apiDeleteAllowed` method, because the `apiDeleteAllowed` option, can be sophisticated and can also be based on the specific item's values,



# angular - Tutorial - Database

# Database

Up until now the todo app has been using a plain JSON file to store the list of tasks. **In production, we'd like to use a `Postgres` database table instead.**

::: tip Learn more
See the [Quickstart](https://remult.dev/docs/quickstart.html#connecting-a-database) article for the (long) list of relational and non-relational databases Remult supports.
:::

::: warning Don't have Postgres installed? Don't have to.
Don't worry if you don't have Postgres installed locally. In the next step of the tutorial, we'll configure the app to use Postgres in production, and keep using JSON files in our dev environment.

**Simply install `postgres-node` per step 1 below and move on to the [Deployment section of the tutorial](deployment.md).**
:::

1. Install `postgres-node` ("pg").

   ```sh
   npm i pg
   ```

2. Add the highlighted code to the `api` server module.

   ```ts{5,9-11}
   // src/server/api.ts

   //...

   import { createPostgresDataProvider } from "remult/postgres"

   export const api = remultExpress({
     //...
     dataProvider: createPostgresDataProvider({
       connectionString: "your connection string"
     })
   })
   ```



# angular - Tutorial - Deployment

# Deployment

Let's deploy the todo app to [railway.app](https://railway.app/).

## Prepare for Production

In this tutorial, we'll deploy both the Angular app and the API server as [one server-side app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#other-solutions), and redirect all non-API requests to return the Angular app.

In addition, to follow a few basic production best practices, we'll use [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) middleware to improve performance and [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) middleware for security

1. Add the highlighted code lines to `src/server/index.ts`, and modify the `app.listen` function's `port` argument to prefer a port number provided by the production host's `PORT` environment variable.

```ts{16-21}
// src/server/index.ts

import express from "express"
import { api } from "./api.js"
import session from "cookie-session"
import { auth } from "./auth.js"

const app = express()
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env["SESSION_SECRET"] || "my secret"
  })
)
app.use(auth)
app.use(api)
const frontendFiles = process.cwd() + "/dist/remult-angular-todo/browser";
app.use(express.static(frontendFiles));
app.get("/*", (_, res) => {
  res.sendFile(frontendFiles + "/index.html");
});
app.listen(process.env["PORT"] || 3002, () => console.log("Server started"));
```

::: warning Angular versions <17
If you're using angular version 16 or less, the result path is: `'/dist/remult-angular-todo/browser`
:::

3. Modify the highlighted code in the api server module to prefer a `connectionString` provided by the production host's `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

   ```ts{4,7-9}
   // src/server/api.ts

   //...
   const DATABASE_URL = process.env["DATABASE_URL"];

   export const api = remultExpress({
    dataProvider: DATABASE_URL
      ? createPostgresDataProvider({ connectionString: DATABASE_URL })
      : undefined,
      //...
    })
   ```

::: warning Note
In order to connect to a local PostgresDB, add `DATABASE_URL` to an .env file, or simply replace `process.env["DATABASE_URL"]` with your `connectionString`.

If no `DATABASE_URL` has found, it'll fallback to our local JSON files.
:::

4. In the root folder, create a TypeScript configuration file `tsconfig.server.json` for the build of the server project using TypeScript.

```json
// tsconfig.server.json

{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "noEmit": false,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "rootDir": "src"
  },
  "include": ["src/server/index.ts"]
}
```

5. Modify the project's `build` npm script to additionally transpile the API server's TypeScript code to JavaScript (using `tsc`).

```json
// package.json

"build": "ng build && tsc -p tsconfig.server.json"
```

6. Modify the project's `start` npm script to start the production Node.js server.

```json
// package.json

"start": "node dist/server/"
```

The todo app is now ready for deployment to production.

## Test Locally

To test the application locally run

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

Now navigate to http://localhost:3002 and test the application locally

## Deploy to Railway

In order to deploy the todo app to [railway](https://railway.app/) you'll need a `railway` account. You'll also need [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli#npm) installed, and you'll need to login to railway from the cli, using `railway login`.

Click enter multiple times to answer all its questions with the default answer

1. Create a Railway `project`.

   From the terminal in your project folder run:

   ```sh
   railway init
   ```

2. Set a project name.
3. Once that's done run the following command to open the project on railway.dev:
   ```sh
   railway open
   ```
4. Once that's done run the following command to upload the project to railway:
   ```sh
   railway up
   ```
5. Add Postgres Database:
   1. In the project on `railway.dev`, click `+ Create`
   2. Select `Database`
   3. Select `Add PostgresSQL`
6. Configure the environment variables
   1. Click on the project card (not the Postgres one)
   2. Switch to the `variables` tab
   3. Click on `+ New Variable`, and in the `VARIABLE_NAME` click `Add Reference` and select `DATABASE_URL`
   4. Add another variable called `SESSION_SECRET` and set it to a random string, you can use an [online UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)
   5. Switch to the `settings` tab
   6. Under `Environment` click on `Generate Domain`
   7. Click on the `Deploy` button on the top left.
7. Once the deployment is complete -
8. Click on the newly generated url to open the app in the browser and you'll see the app live in production. (it may take a few minutes to go live)

::: warning Note
If you run into trouble deploying the app to Railway, try using Railway's [documentation](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/deployments).
:::

That's it - our application is deployed to production, play with it and enjoy.

# angular - Tutorial - Appendix: Observable Live Query

# Appendix - Observable Live Query

To use `liveQuery` as an observable add the following utility function to your code

```ts
// src/app/from-live-query.ts

import { LiveQuery } from 'remult'
import { Observable } from 'rxjs'

export function fromLiveQuery<T>(q: LiveQuery<T>) {
  return new Observable<T[]>((sub) =>
    q.subscribe(({ items }) => sub.next(items)),
  )
}
```

1. Adjust the `TodoComponent`

   ```ts{4,6-11}
   // src/app/todo/todo.component.ts

   ...
   export class TodoComponent {
     taskRepo = remult.repo(Task);
     tasks$ = fromLiveQuery(
       this.taskRepo.liveQuery({
         limit: 20,
         orderBy: { createdAt: 'asc' },
       })
     );
   ```

   Note that we've removed `ngOnInit` and `ngOnDestroy` as they are no longer needed

2. Adjust the `todo.component.html`

   ```html{3}
   <!-- src/app/todo/todo.component.html -->

   <div *ngFor="let task of tasks$ | async">
     <input
       type="checkbox"

     />
     <input [(ngModel)]="task.title" />
     <button (click)="saveTask(task)">Save</button>
     <button
       *ngIf="taskRepo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(task)"
       (click)="deleteTask(task)"
     >
       Delete
     </button>
   </div>
   ```



# vue - Tutorial - Setup

# Build a Full-Stack Vue Application

### Create a simple todo app with Remult using a Vue frontend

In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple app to manage a task list. We'll use `Vue` for the UI, `Node.js` + `Express.js` for the API server, and Remult as our full-stack CRUD framework. For deployment to production, we'll use [railway.app](https://railway.app/) and a `PostgreSQL` database.

By the end of the tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Remult and how to use it to accelerate and simplify full stack app development.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with `TypeScript` and `Vue`.

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. <!-- consider specifying Node minimum version with npm -->

# Setup for the Tutorial

This tutorial requires setting up a Vue project, an API server project, and a few lines of code to add Remult.

You can either **use a starter project** to speed things up, or go through the **step-by-step setup**.

## Option 1: Clone the Starter Project

1. Clone the _vue-express-starter_ repository from GitHub and install its dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/remult/vue-express-starter.git remult-vue-todo
cd remult-vue-todo
npm install
```

2. Open your IDE.
3. Open a terminal and run the `dev` npm script.

```sh
npm run dev
```

4. Open another terminal and run the `dev-node` npm script

```sh
npm run dev-node
```

The default "Vue" app main screen should be available at the default Vite dev server address [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173).

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.

## Option 2: Step-by-step Setup

### Create a Vue project

Create the new Vue project.

```sh
npm init -y vue@latest
```

The command command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app project. Here are the answers used in this tutorial:

1. Project name: ... **remult-vue-todo**
2. Add Typescript? ... **Yes**
3. For the rest of the answers, simply select the default.

::: warning Run into issues scaffolding the Vite project?
See [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) for help.
:::
Once completed, run:

```sh
cd remult-vue-todo
```

In this tutorial, we'll be using the root folder created by `Vue` as the root folder for our server project as well.

### Install required packages

We need `Express` to serve our app's API, and, of course, `Remult`. For development, we'll use [tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) to run the API server.

```sh
npm i express remult
npm i --save-dev @types/express tsx
```

### Create the API server project

The starter API server TypeScript project contains a single module that initializes `Express`, and begins listening for API requests.

1. Open your IDE.

2. Create a `server` folder under the `src/` folder created by Vite.

3. Create an `index.ts` file in the `src/server/` folder with the following code:

```ts
// src/server/index.ts

import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.listen(3002, () => console.log('Server started'))
```

### Bootstrap Remult in the back-end

Remult is loaded in the back-end as an `Express middleware`.

1. Create an `api.ts` file in the `src/server/` folder with the following code:

```ts
// src/server/api.ts

import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'

export const api = remultExpress()
```

2. Add the highlighted code lines to register the middleware in the main server module `index.ts`.

```ts{4,7}
// src/server/index.ts

import express from "express"
import { api } from "./api.js"

const app = express()
app.use(api)

app.listen(3002, () => console.log("Server started"))
```

::: warning ESM
In this tutorial we will be using `esm` for the node.js server - that means that where ever we import a file we have to include the `.js` suffix for it as we did above in the `import { api } from "./api.js` statement
:::

### Final tweaks

Our full stack starter project is almost ready. Let's complete these final configurations.

#### Enable TypeScript decorators in Vite

Add the following entry to the `defineConfig` section of the `vite.config.ts` file to enable the use of decorators in the Vue app.

```ts{6-12}
// vite.config.ts

// ...
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  esbuild: {
    tsconfigRaw: {
      compilerOptions: {
        experimentalDecorators: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Create the server tsconfig file

In the root folder, create a TypeScript configuration file `tsconfig.server.json` for the server project.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "module": "nodenext"
  },
  "include": ["src/server/**/*", "src/shared/**/*"]
}
```

#### Proxy API requests from Vue DevServer (vite) to the API server

The Vue app created in this tutorial is intended to be served from the same domain as its API.
However, for development, the API server will be listening on `http://localhost:3002`, while the Vue app is served from the default `http://localhost:5173`.

We'll use the [proxy](https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-proxy) feature of Vite to divert all calls for `http://localhost:5173/api` to our dev API server.

Configure the proxy by adding the following entry to the `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts{6}
// vite.config.ts

//...
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  server: { proxy: { "/api": "http://localhost:3002" } },
  esbuild: {
    tsconfigRaw: {
      compilerOptions: {
        experimentalDecorators: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Run the app

1. Open a terminal and start the vite dev server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

2. Add an `npm` script named `dev-node` to start the dev API server in the `package.json`.

```json
// package.json

"dev-node": "tsx watch --tsconfig tsconfig.server.json src/server"
```

3. Open another terminal and start the `node` server

```sh
npm run dev-node
```

The server is now running and listening on port 3002. `tsx` is watching for file changes and will restart the server when code changes are saved.

The default "Vue" app main screen should be available at the default Vite dev server address [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173).

### Remove Vue default styles

The vue default styles won't fit our todo app. If you'd like a nice-looking app, replace the contents of `src/assets/main.css` with [this CSS file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remult/vue-express-starter/master/src/assets/main.css). Otherwise, you can simply **delete the contents of `src/assets/main.css`**.

### Setup completed

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.



# vue - Tutorial - Entities

# Entities

Let's start coding the app by defining the `Task` entity class.

The `Task` entity class will be used:

- As a model class for client-side code
- As a model class for server-side code
- By `remult` to generate API endpoints, API queries, and database commands

The `Task` entity class we're creating will have an auto-generated `id` field, a `title` field, a `completed` field and an auto-generated `createdAt` field. The entity's API route ("tasks") will include endpoints for all `CRUD` operations.

## Define the Model

1. Create a `shared` folder under the `src` folder. This folder will contain code shared between frontend and backend.

2. Create a file `Task.ts` in the `src/shared/` folder, with the following code:

```ts
// src/shared/Task.ts

import { Entity, Fields } from "remult"

@Entity("tasks", {
  allowApiCrud: true
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ""

  @Fields.string()
  title = ""

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false

  @Fields.createdAt()
  createdAt?: Date
}
```

3. In the server's `api` module, register the `Task` entity with Remult by adding `entities: [Task]` to an `options` object you pass to the `remultExpress()` middleware:

```ts{4,7}
// src/server/api.ts

import { remultExpress } from "remult/remult-express"
import { Task } from "../shared/Task.js"

export const api = remultExpress({
  entities: [Task]
})
```

::: warning ESM
In this tutorial we will be using `esm` for the node.js server - that means that where ever we import a file we have to include the `.js` suffix for it as we did above in the `import { Task } from "../shared/Task.js"` statement
:::

The [@Entity](../../docs/ref_entity.md) decorator tells Remult this class is an entity class. The decorator accepts a `key` argument (used to name the API route and as a default database collection/table name), and an `options` argument used to define entity-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial.

To initially allow all CRUD operations for tasks, we set the option [allowApiCrud](../../docs/ref_entity.md#allowapicrud) to `true`.

The [@Fields.cuid](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-cuid) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a short random id using the [cuid](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid) library. This value can't be changed after the entity is created.

The [@Fields.string](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-string) decorator tells Remult the `title` property is an entity data field of type `String`. This decorator is also used to define field-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial and the same goes for `@Fields.boolean` and the `completed` property.

The [@Fields.createdAt](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-createdat) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a `createdAt` field with the current date and time.

::: tip
For a complete list of supported field types, see the [Field Types](../../docs/field-types.md) section in the Remult documentation.
:::

## Test the API

Now that the `Task` entity is defined, we can start using the REST API to query and add a tasks.

1. Open a browser with the url: [http://localhost:3002/api/tasks](http://localhost:3002/api/tasks), and you'll see that you get an empty array.

2. Use `curl` to `POST` a new task - *Clean car*.

```sh
curl http://localhost:3002/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"Clean car\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

3. Refresh the browser for the url: [http://localhost:3002/api/tasks](http://localhost:3002/api/tasks) and see that the array now contains one item.

4. Use `curl` to `POST` a few more tasks:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3002/api/tasks -d "[{\"title\": \"Read a book\"},{\"title\": \"Take a nap\", \"completed\":true },{\"title\": \"Pay bills\"},{\"title\": \"Do laundry\"}]" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

- Note that the `POST` endpoint can accept a single `Task` or an array of `Task`s.

5. Refresh the browser again, to see that the tasks were stored in the db.

::: warning Wait, where is the backend database?
While remult supports [many relational and non-relational databases](https://remult.dev/docs/databases.html), in this tutorial we start by storing entity data in a backend **JSON file**. Notice that a `db` folder has been created under the root folder, with a `tasks.json` file containing the created tasks.
:::

## Admin UI

### Enabling the Admin UI

Add the Admin UI to your React application by setting the `admin` option to `true` in the `remultExpress()`

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express'
import { Task } from '../shared/Task.js'

export const api = remultExpress({
  entities: [Task],
  admin: true, // Enable the Admin UI
})
```

:::

### Accessing and Using the Admin UI

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/api/admin` to access the Admin UI. Here, you can perform CRUD operations on your entities, view their relationships via the Diagram entry, and ensure secure management with the same validations and authorizations as your application.

![Remult Admin](/remult-admin.png)

### Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Directly create, update, and delete tasks through the Admin UI.
- **Entity Diagram**: Visualize relationships between entities for better data structure understanding.
- **Security**: Operations are secure, adhering to application-defined rules.

## Display the Task List

Let's start developing the web app by displaying the list of existing tasks in a Vue component.

Replace the contents of `src/App.vue` with the following code:

```vue
// src/App.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
import { onMounted, ref } from "vue";
import { remult } from "remult";
import { Task } from "./shared/Task";

const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task);
const tasks = ref<Task[]>([]);
onMounted(() => taskRepo.find().then((items) => (tasks.value = items)));
</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>todos</h1>
    <main>
      <div v-for="task in tasks">
        <input type="checkbox" v-model="task.completed" />
        {{ task.title }}
      </div>
    </main>
  </div>
</template>

```

Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet:

- `taskRepo` is a Remult [Repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md) object used to fetch and create Task entity objects.
- `tasks` is a Task array Vue `ref` that holds the list of tasks.
- Vue's `onMounted` hook is used to call the Remult [repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md)'s [find](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method to fetch tasks from the server, once when the Vue component is loaded.

After the browser refreshes, the list of tasks appears.



# vue - Tutorial - Paging, Sorting and Filtering

# Paging, Sorting and Filtering

The RESTful API created by Remult supports **server-side paging, sorting, and filtering**. Let's use that to limit, sort and filter the list of tasks.

## Limit Number of Fetched Tasks

Since our database may eventually contain a lot of tasks, it make sense to use a **paging strategy** to limit the number of tasks retrieved in a single fetch from the back-end database.

Let's limit the number of fetched tasks to `20`.

In the `onMounted` hook, pass an `options` argument to the `find` method call and set its `limit` property to 20.

```ts{6}
// src/App.vue

onMounted(() =>
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20
    })
    .then(items => (tasks.value = items))
)
```

There aren't enough tasks in the database for this change to have an immediate effect, but it will have one later on when we'll add more tasks.

::: tip
To query subsequent pages, use the [Repository.find()](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method's `page` option.
:::

## Sorting By Creation Date

We would like old tasks to appear first in the list, and new tasks to appear last. Let's sort the tasks by their `createdAt` field.

In the `onMounted` hook, set the `orderBy` property of the `find` method call's `option` argument to an object that contains the fields you want to sort by.
Use "asc" and "desc" to determine the sort order.

```ts{7}
// src/App.vue

onMounted(() =>
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
    })
    .then(items => (tasks.value = items))
)
```

## Server side Filtering

Remult supports sending filter rules to the server to query only the tasks that we need.

Adjust the `onMounted` hook to fetch only `completed` tasks.

```ts{8}
// src/App.vue

onMounted(() =>
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" },
      where: { completed: true }
    })
    .then(items => (tasks.value = items))
)
```

::: warning Note
Because the `completed` field is of type `boolean`, the argument is **compile-time checked to be of the `boolean` type**. Settings the `completed` filter to `undefined` causes it to be ignored by Remult.
:::

Play with different filtering values, and eventually comment it out, since we do need all the tasks

```ts{6}
onMounted(() =>
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
      //where: { completed: true }
    })
    .then(items => (tasks.value = items))
)
```

::: tip Learn more

:::



# vue - Tutorial - CRUD Operations

# CRUD Operations

## Adding new tasks

Now that we can see the list of tasks, it's time to add a few more.

Add the highlighted `newTaskTitle` ref and `addTask` function, and the relevant `<form>` to the App Component

```vue{5-14,20-23}
// src/App.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
//...
const newTaskTitle = ref("")
async function addTask() {
  try {
    const newTask = await taskRepo.insert({ title: newTaskTitle.value })
    tasks.value.push(newTask)
    newTaskTitle.value = ""
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    alert((error as { message: string }).message)
  }
}
</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>todos</h1>
    <main>
      <form @submit.prevent="addTask()">
        <input v-model="newTaskTitle" placeholder="What needs to be done?" />
        <button>Add</button>
      </form>
      <div v-for="task in tasks">
        <input type="checkbox" v-model="task.completed" />
        {{ task.title }}
      </div>
    </main>
  </div>
</template>
```

- the call to `taskRepo.insert` will make a post request to the server, insert the new task to the `db`, and return the new `Task` object with all it's info (including the id generated by the database)

Try adding a few tasks to see how it works

## Rename Tasks and Mark as Completed

To make the tasks in the list updatable, we'll bind the `input` elements to the `Task` properties and add a _Save_ button to save the changes to the backend database.

```vue{5-11,16-18}
// src/App.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
//...
async function saveTask(task: Task) {
  try {
    await taskRepo.save(task)
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    alert((error as { message: string }).message)
  }
}
</script>
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <div v-for="task in tasks">
    <input type="checkbox" v-model="task.completed" @change="saveTask(task)" />
    <input v-model="task.title" />
    <button @click="saveTask(task)">Save</button>
  </div>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

- The `taskRepo.save` method update the `task` to the server and returns the updated value
- - The `saveTask` function, called from the `button`'s `click` event, and the `checkbox`'s change event saves the `task` object to the backend.
    Make some changes and refresh the browser to verify the backend database is updated.

::: tip Browser's Network tab
As you play with these `CRUD` capabilities, monitor the network tab and see that they are all translated to `rest` api calls.
:::

## Delete Tasks

Let's add a _Delete_ button next to the _Save_ button of each task in the list.

Add the highlighted `deleteTask` function and _Delete_ `button`

```vue{5-12,20}
// src/App.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
//...
async function deleteTask(task: Task) {
  try {
    await taskRepo.delete(task)
    tasks.value = tasks.value.filter(t => task !== t)
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    alert((error as { message: string }).message)
  }
}
</script>
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <div v-for="task in tasks">
    <input type="checkbox" v-model="task.completed" @change="saveTask(task)" />
    <input v-model="task.title" />
    <button @click="saveTask(task)">Save</button>
    <button @click="deleteTask(task)">Delete</button>
  </div>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```



# vue - Tutorial - Validation

# Validation

Validating user entered data is usually required both on the client-side and on the server-side, often causing a violation of the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) design principle. **With Remult, validation code can be placed within the entity class, and Remult will run the validation logic on both the frontend and the relevant API requests.**

::: warning Handling validation errors

When a validation error occurs, Remult will throw an exception. 

In this tutorial, [CRUD operations](crud.md) catch these exceptions, and alert the user.
We leave it to you to decide how to handle validation errors in your application.
:::

## Validate the Title Field

Task titles are required. Let's add a validity check for this rule.

1. In the `Task` entity class, modify the `Fields.string` decorator for the `title` field to include an object literal argument and set the object's `validate` property to `Validators.required`.

```ts{3-5}
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Fields.string({
  validate: Validators.required
})
title = ""
```

::: warning Import Validators
This code requires adding an import of `Validators` from `remult`.
:::

::: warning Manual browser refresh required
For this change to take effect, you **must manually refresh the browser**.
:::

After the browser is refreshed, try creating a new `task` or saving an existing one with an empty title - the _"Should not be empty"_ error message is displayed.

### Implicit server-side validation

The validation code we've added is called by Remult on the server-side to validate any API calls attempting to modify the `title` field.

Try making the following `POST` http request to the `http://localhost:3002/api/tasks` API route, providing an invalid title.

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3002/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

An http error is returned and the validation error text is included in the response body,

## Custom Validation

The `validate` property of the first argument of `Remult` field decorators can be set to an arrow function which will be called to validate input on both front-end and back-end.

Try something like this and see what happens:

```ts
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Fields.string<Task>({
  validate: (task) => {
    if (task.title.length < 3) throw "Too Short"
  }
})
title = ""
```



# vue - Tutorial - Live Queries

# Live Queries

Our todo list app can have multiple users using it at the same time. However, changes made by one user are not seen by others unless they manually refresh the browser.

Let's add realtime multiplayer capabilities to this app.

## Realtime updated todo list

Let's switch from fetching Tasks once when the Vue component is loaded, and manually maintaining state for CRUD operations, to using a realtime updated live query subscription **for both initial data fetching and subsequent state changes**.

Adjust the `onMounted` hook in the `App.vue` file

```ts{4,6,11}
// src/App.vue

onMounted(() =>
  onUnmounted(
    taskRepo
      .liveQuery({
        limit: 20,
        orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
        //where: { completed: true },
      })
      .subscribe(info => (tasks.value = info.applyChanges(tasks.value)))
  )
)
```

Let's review the change:

- Instead of calling the `repository`'s `find` method we now call the `liveQuery` method to define the query, and then call its `subscribe` method to establish a subscription which will update the Tasks state in realtime.
- The `subscribe` method accepts a callback with an `info` object that has 3 members:
  - `items` - an up to date list of items representing the current result - it's useful for readonly use cases.
  - `applyChanges` - a method that receives an array and applies the changes to it - we send that method to the `setTasks` state function, to apply the changes to the existing `tasks` state.
  - `changes` - a detailed list of changes that were received
- The `subscribe` method returns an `unsubscribe` function, we return it to the `onUnmounted` hook so that it'll be called when the component unmounts.

2. As all relevant CRUD operations (made by all users) will **immediately update the component's state**, we should remove the manual adding of new Tasks to the component's state:

```ts{6}
// src/App.vue

async function addTask() {
  try {
    const newTask = await taskRepo.insert({ title: newTaskTitle.value })
    //tasks.value.push(newTask) <-- this line is no longer needed
    newTaskTitle.value = ""
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    alert((error as { message: string }).message)
  }
}
```

3. Optionally remove other redundant state changing code:

```ts{6}
// src/App.vue

async function deleteTask(task: Task) {
  try {
    await taskRepo.delete(task)
    //tasks.value = tasks.value.filter((t) => task !== t); <-- this line is no longer needed
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    alert((error as { message: string }).message)
  }
}
```

Open the todo app in two (or more) browser windows/tabs, make some changes in one window and notice how the others are updated in realtime.

::: tip Under the hood
The default implementation of live-queries uses HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push realtime updates to clients, and stores live-query information in-memory.

For serverless environments _(or multi servers)_, live-query updates can be pushed using integration with third-party realtime providers, such as [Ably](https://ably.com/) (or others), and live-query information can be stored to any database supported by Remult.
:::



# vue - Tutorial - Backend methods

# Backend methods

When performing operations on multiple entity objects, performance considerations may necessitate running them on the server. **With Remult, moving client-side logic to run on the server is a simple refactoring**.

## Set All Tasks as Un/completed

Let's add two buttons to the todo app: "Set all as completed" and "Set all as uncompleted".

1. Add a `setAllCompleted` async function to the `App` function component, which accepts a `completed` boolean argument and sets the value of the `completed` field of all the tasks accordingly.

   ```ts
   // src/App.vue

   async function setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
     for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
       await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
     }
   }
   ```

   The `for` loop iterates the array of `Task` objects returned from the backend, and saves each task back to the backend with a modified value in the `completed` field.

2. Add the two buttons to the end of the `</main>` section of the `App` component. Both of the buttons' `@click` events will call the `setAllCompleted` function with the appropriate value of the `completed` argument.

   ```vue
   // src/App.vue

   <div>
     <button @click="setAllCompleted(true)">Set All as Completed</button>
     <button @click="setAllCompleted(false)">Set All as Uncompleted</button>
   </div>
   ```

Make sure the buttons are working as expected before moving on to the next step.

## Refactor from Front-end to Back-end

With the current state of the `setAllCompleted` function, each modified task being saved causes an API `PUT` request handled separately by the server. As the number of tasks in the todo list grows, this may become a performance issue.

A simple way to prevent this is to expose an API endpoint for `setAllCompleted` requests, and run the same logic on the server instead of the client.

1. Create a new `TasksController` class, in the `shared` folder, and refactor the `for` loop from the `setAllCompleted` function of the `App` function component into a new, `static`, `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController` class, which will run on the server.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

import { BackendMethod, remult } from "remult"
import { Task } from "./Task.js"

export class TasksController {
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
    const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task)

    for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
      await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
    }
  }
}
```

The `@BackendMethod` decorator tells Remult to expose the method as an API endpoint (the `allowed` property will be discussed later on in this tutorial).

**Unlike the front-end `Remult` object, the server implementation interacts directly with the database.**

2. Register `TasksController` by adding it to the `controllers` array of the `options` object passed to `remultExpress()`, in the server's `api` module:

```ts{4,8}
// src/server/api.ts

//...
import { TasksController } from "../shared/TasksController.js"

export const api = remultExpress({
  //...
  controllers: [TasksController]
})
```

3. Replace the `for` iteration in the `setAllCompleted` function of the `App` component with a call to the `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController`.

```ts{4}
// src/App.vue

async function setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
  await TasksController.setAllCompleted(completed)
}
```

::: warning Import TasksController
Remember to add an import of `TasksController` in `App.vue`.
:::

::: tip Note
With Remult backend methods, argument types are compile-time checked. :thumbsup:
:::

After the browser refreshed, the _"Set all..."_ buttons function exactly the same, but much faster.



# vue - Tutorial - Authentication and Authorization

# Authentication and Authorization

Our todo app is nearly functionally complete, but it still doesn't fulfill a very basic requirement - that users should log in before they can view, create or modify tasks.

Remult provides a flexible mechanism that enables placing **code-based authorization rules** at various levels of the application's API. To maintain high code cohesion, **entity and field-level authorization code should be placed in entity classes**.

**Remult is completely unopinionated when it comes to user authentication.** You are free to use any kind of authentication mechanism, and only required to provide Remult with an object which implements the Remult `UserInfo` interface.

In this tutorial, we'll use `Express`'s [cookie-session](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-session.html) middleware to store an authenticated user's session within a cookie. The `user` property of the session will be set by the API server upon a successful simplistic sign-in (based on username without password).

## Tasks CRUD Requires Sign-in

This rule is implemented within the `Task` `@Entity` decorator, by modifying the value of the `allowApiCrud` property.
This property can be set to a function that accepts a `Remult` argument and returns a `boolean` value. Let's use the `Allow.authenticated` function from Remult.

```ts{4}
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Entity("tasks", {
    allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated
})
```

::: warning Import Allow
This code requires adding an import of `Allow` from `remult`.
:::

After the browser refreshes, **the list of tasks disappeared** and the user can no longer create new tasks.

::: details Inspect the HTTP error returned by the API using cURL

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3002/api/tasks
```

:::

::: danger Authorized server-side code can still modify tasks
Although client CRUD requests to `tasks` API endpoints now require a signed-in user, the API endpoint created for our `setAllCompleted` server function remains available to unauthenticated requests. Since the `allowApiCrud` rule we implemented does not affect the server-side code's ability to use the `Task` entity class for performing database CRUD operations, **the `setAllCompleted` function still works as before**.

To fix this, let's implement the same rule using the `@BackendMethod` decorator of the `setAllCompleted` method of `TasksController`.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

@BackendMethod({ allowed: Allow.authenticated })
```

**This code requires adding an import of `Allow` from `remult`.**
:::

## User Authentication

Let's add a sign-in area to the todo app, with an `input` for typing in a `username` and a sign-in `button`. The app will have two valid `username` values - _"Jane"_ and _"Steve"_. After a successful sign-in, the sign-in area will be replaced by a "Hi [username]" message.

### Backend setup

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to install the required packages:

```sh
npm i cookie-session
npm i --save-dev @types/cookie-session
```

2. Modify the main server module `index.ts` to use the `cookie-session` Express middleware.

   ```ts{5,8-12}
   // src/server/index.ts

   //...

   import session from "cookie-session"

   const app = express()
   app.use(
     session({
       secret: process.env["SESSION_SECRET"] || "my secret"
     })
   )

   //...
   ```

   The `cookie-session` middleware stores session data, digitally signed using the value of the `secret` property, in an `httpOnly` cookie, sent by the browser to all subsequent API requests.

3. add a `shared/AuthController.ts` file and include the following code:

   ```ts add={4-6,8-12}
   // src/shared/AuthController.ts

   import { BackendMethod, remult } from 'remult'
   import type express from 'express'
   // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
   import type from 'cookie-session' // required to access the session member of the request object

   declare module 'remult' {
     export interface RemultContext {
       request?: express.Request
     }
   }

   export class AuthController {
     //
   }
   ```

   ### Code Explanation

   - We import the necessary modules from `remult` and types for `express` and `cookie-session`.
   - We extend the `RemultContext` interface to include an optional `request` property of type `express.Request`.
   - Remult will automatically set the `request` with the current request. Since Remult works with any server framework, we need to type it to the correct server, which in this case is Express. This typing gives us access to the request object and its session, managed by `cookie-session`.
   - This `request` can be accessed using `remult.context.request`.

   Next, we'll add a static list of users and a sign-in method. (In a real application, you would use a database, but for this tutorial, a static list will suffice.)

   ```ts add={1,4-17}
   const validUsers = [{ name: 'Jane' }, { name: 'Alex' }]

   export class AuthController {
     @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
     static async signIn(name: string) {
       const user = validUsers.find((user) => user.name === name)
       if (user) {
         remult.user = {
           id: user.name,
           name: user.name,
         }
         remult.context.request!.session!['user'] = remult.user
         return remult.user
       } else {
         throw Error("Invalid user, try 'Alex' or 'Jane'")
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   ### Code Explanation

   - We define a static list of valid users.
   - The `signIn` method is decorated with `@BackendMethod({ allowed: true })`, making it accessible from the frontend.
   - The method checks if the provided `name` exists in the `validUsers` list. If it does, it sets `remult.user` to an object that conforms to the `UserInfo` type from Remult and stores this user in the request session.
   - If the user is not found, it throws an error.

   Next, we'll add the sign-out method:

   ```ts add={7-11}
   export class AuthController {
     @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
     static async signIn(name: string) {
       //...
     }

     @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
     static async signOut() {
       remult.context.request!.session!['user'] = undefined
       return undefined
     }
   }
   ```

   - The `signOut` method clears the user session, making the user unauthenticated.

4. Update `remultExpress` configuration.

   ```ts{3,5,6}
   // src/server/api.ts

   import { AuthController } from '../shared/AuthController.js'

   export const api = remultExpress({
     //...
     controllers: [TaskController, AuthController]
     getUser: (req) => req.session!['user'],
   })
   ```

   ### Code Explanation

   - Register the `AuthController` so that the frontend can call its `signIn` and `signOut` methods
   - `getUser` function: The getUser function is responsible for extracting the user information from the session. If a user is found in the session, Remult will treat the request as authenticated, and this user will be used for authorization purposes.

### Frontend setup

1. Create a file `src/Auth.vue` and place the following `Auth` component code in it:

   ```vue
   // src/Auth.vue

   <script setup lang="ts">
   import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue'
   import { remult } from 'remult'
   import App from './App.vue'
   import { AuthController } from './shared/AuthController'

   const username = ref('')
   const signedIn = ref(false)

   const signIn = async () => {
     try {
       remult.user = await AuthController.signIn(username)
       signedIn.value = true
       username.value = ''
     } catch (error: unknown) {
       alert((error as { message: string }).message)
     }
   }
   const signOut = async () => {
     await AuthController.signOut()
     remult.user = undefined
     signedIn.value = false
   }

   onMounted(async () => {
     await remult.initUser()
     signedIn.value = remult.authenticated()
   })
   </script>
   <template>
     <div v-if="!signedIn">
       <h1>todos</h1>
       <main>
         <form @submit.prevent="signIn()">
           <input
             v-model="username"
             placeholder="Username, try Steve or Jane"
           />
           <button>Sign in</button>
         </form>
       </main>
     </div>
     <div v-else>
       <header>
         Hello {{ remult.user!.name }}
         <button @click="signOut()">Sign Out</button>
       </header>
       <App />
     </div>
   </template>
   ```

2. In the `main.vue` file, change the `rootComponent` to `Auth`.

   ```ts{4,8}
   // src/main.ts

   import { createApp } from "vue"
   import Auth from "./Auth.vue"

   import "./assets/main.css"

   createApp(Auth).mount("#app")
   ```

The todo app now supports signing in and out, with **all access restricted to signed in users only**.

## Role-based Authorization

Usually, not all application users have the same privileges. Let's define an `admin` role for our todo app, and enforce the following authorization rules:

- All signed in users can see the list of tasks.
- All signed in users can set specific tasks as `completed`.
- Only users belonging to the `admin` role can create, delete or edit the titles of tasks.

1. Modify the highlighted lines in the `Task` entity class to reflect the top three authorization rules.

```ts{7-8,18}
// src/shared/Task.ts

import { Allow, Entity, Fields, Validators } from "remult"

@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated,
  allowApiInsert: "admin",
  allowApiDelete: "admin"
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.uuid()
  id!: string

  @Fields.string({
    validate: (task) => {
      if (task.title.length < 3) throw "Too Short"
    }
    allowApiUpdate: "admin"
  })
  title = ""

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false
}
```

2. Let's give the user _"Jane"_ the `admin` role by modifying the `roles` array of her `validUsers` entry.

```ts{3,13}
// src/shared/AuthController.ts

const validUsers = [{ name: "Jane", admin: true }, { name: "Steve" }];

export class AuthController {
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async signIn(name: string) {
    const user = validUsers.find((user) => user.name === name);
    if (user) {
      remult.user = {
        id: user.name,
        name: user.name,
        roles: user.admin ? ["admin"] : [],
      };
      remult.context.request!.session!["user"] = remult.user;
      return remult.user;
    } else {
      throw Error("Invalid user, try 'Steve' or 'Jane'");
    }
  }
```

**Sign in to the app as _"Steve"_ to test that the actions restricted to `admin` users are not allowed. :lock:**

## Role-based Authorization on the Frontend

From a user experience perspective it only makes sense that users that can't add or delete, would not see these buttons.

Let's reuse the same definitions on the Frontend.

We'll use the entity's metadata to only show the form if the user is allowed to insert

```vue{8,23}
// src/App.vue

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>todos</h1>
    <main>
      <form
        v-if="taskRepo.metadata.apiInsertAllowed()"
        @submit.prevent="addTask()"
      >
        <input v-model="newTaskTitle" placeholder="What needs to be done?" />
        <button>Add</button>
      </form>
      <div v-for="task in tasks">
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          v-model="task.completed"
          @change="saveTask(task)"
        />
        <input v-model="task.title" />
        <button @click="saveTask(task)">Save</button>
        <button
          v-if="taskRepo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(task)"
          @click="deleteTask(task)"
        >
          Delete
        </button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button @click="setAllCompleted(true)">Set All as Completed</button>
        <button @click="setAllCompleted(false)">Set All as Uncompleted</button>
      </div>
    </main>
  </div>
</template>
```

This way we can keep the frontend consistent with the `api`'s Authorization rules

- Note We send the `task` to the `apiDeleteAllowed` method, because the `apiDeleteAllowed` option, can be sophisticated and can also be based on the specific item's values.



# vue - Tutorial - Database

# Database

Up until now the todo app has been using a plain JSON file to store the list of tasks. **In production, we'd like to use a `Postgres` database table instead.**

::: tip Learn more
See the [Quickstart](https://remult.dev/docs/quickstart.html#connecting-a-database) article for the (long) list of relational and non-relational databases Remult supports.
:::

::: warning Don't have Postgres installed? Don't have to.
Don't worry if you don't have Postgres installed locally. In the next step of the tutorial, we'll configure the app to use Postgres in production, and keep using JSON files in our dev environment.

**Simply install `postgres-node` per step 1 below and move on to the [Deployment section of the tutorial](deployment.md).**
:::

1. Install `postgres-node` ("pg").

   ```sh
   npm i pg
   ```

2. Add the highlighted code to the `api` server module.

   ```ts{5,9-11}
   // src/server/api.ts

   //...

   import { createPostgresDataProvider } from "remult/postgres"

   export const api = remultExpress({
     //...
     dataProvider: createPostgresDataProvider({
       connectionString: "your connection string"
     })
   })
   ```



# vue - Tutorial - Deployment

# Deployment

Let's deploy the todo app to [railway.app](https://railway.app/).

## Prepare for Production

In this tutorial, we'll deploy both the Vue app and the API server as [one server-side app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#other-solutions), and redirect all non-API requests to return the Vue app.

We will deploy an ESM node server project
In addition, to follow a few basic production best practices, we'll use [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) middleware to improve performance and [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) middleware for security

1. Add the highlighted code lines to `src/server/index.ts`, and modify the `app.listen` function's `port` argument to prefer a port number provided by the production host's `PORT` environment variable.

```ts{16-21}
// src/server/index.ts

import express from "express"
import { api } from "./api.js"
import session from "cookie-session"
import { auth } from "./auth.js"

const app = express()
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env["SESSION_SECRET"] || "my secret"
  })
)
app.use(auth)
app.use(api)
const frontendFiles = process.cwd() + "/dist";
app.use(express.static(frontendFiles));
app.get("/*", (_, res) => {
  res.sendFile(frontendFiles + "/index.html");
});
app.listen(process.env["PORT"] || 3002, () => console.log("Server started"));
```

3. Modify the highlighted code in the api server module to prefer a `connectionString` provided by the production host's `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

   ```ts{4,7-9}
   // src/server/api.ts

   //...
   const DATABASE_URL = process.env["DATABASE_URL"];

   export const api = remultExpress({
    dataProvider: DATABASE_URL
      ? createPostgresDataProvider({ connectionString: DATABASE_URL })
      : undefined,
      //...
    })
   ```

::: warning Note
In order to connect to a local PostgresDB, add `DATABASE_URL` to an .env file, or simply replace `process.env["DATABASE_URL"]` with your `connectionString`.

If no `DATABASE_URL` has found, it'll fallback to our local JSON files.
:::

4. Modify the project's `build` npm script to additionally transpile the API server's TypeScript code to JavaScript (using `tsc`).

```json
// package.json

"build": "run-p type-check \"build-only {@}\" -- && tsc -p tsconfig.server.json"
```

5. Add `start` npm script to start the production Node.js server.

```json
// package.json

"start": "node dist/server/"
```

The todo app is now ready for deployment to production.

## Test Locally

To test the application locally run

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

::: warning Build Errors
If you get an error `error TS5096: Option 'allowImportingTsExtensions' can only be used when either 'noEmit' or 'emitDeclarationOnly' is set.` do not set the `emitDeclarationOnly` flag!

You are getting the error because somewhere in your code you've imported from `.ts` instead of `.js` - fix it and build again
:::

Now navigate to http://localhost:3002 and test the application locally

## Deploy to Railway

In order to deploy the todo app to [railway](https://railway.app/) you'll need a `railway` account. You'll also need [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli#npm) installed, and you'll need to login to railway from the cli, using `railway login`.

Click enter multiple times to answer all its questions with the default answer

1. Create a Railway `project`.

   From the terminal in your project folder run:

   ```sh
   railway init
   ```

2. Set a project name.
3. Once that's done run the following command to open the project on railway.dev:
   ```sh
   railway open
   ```
4. Once that's done run the following command to upload the project to railway:
   ```sh
   railway up
   ```
5. Add Postgres Database:
   1. In the project on `railway.dev`, click `+ Create`
   2. Select `Database`
   3. Select `Add PostgresSQL`
6. Configure the environment variables
   1. Click on the project card (not the Postgres one)
   2. Switch to the `variables` tab
   3. Click on `+ New Variable`, and in the `VARIABLE_NAME` click `Add Reference` and select `DATABASE_URL`
   4. Add another variable called `SESSION_SECRET` and set it to a random string, you can use an [online UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)
   5. Switch to the `settings` tab
   6. Under `Environment` click on `Generate Domain`
   7. Click on the `Deploy` button on the top left.
7. Once the deployment is complete -
8. Click on the newly generated url to open the app in the browser and you'll see the app live in production. (it may take a few minutes to go live)

::: warning Note
If you run into trouble deploying the app to Railway, try using Railway's [documentation](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/deployments).

# SvelteKit - Tutorial - Setup

# Build a Full-Stack SvelteKit Application

### Create a simple todo app with Remult using a SvelteKit

In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple app to manage a task list. We'll use `SvelteKit` for the UI & the backend and Remult as our full-stack CRUD framework.

By the end of the tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Remult and how to use it to accelerate and simplify full stack app development.

::: tip You want to have a look at the end result ?
You can `degit` the final result and read the `README.md` file in the project to check it out.

```sh
npx degit remult/remult/examples/sveltekit-todo remult-sveltekit-todo
cd remult-sveltekit-todo
```

:::

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with `SvelteKit`.

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

# Setup for the Tutorial

This tutorial requires setting up a Sveltekit project, and a few lines of code to add Remult.

## Step-by-step Setup

### Create a Sveltekit project

Create the new Sveltekit project.

```sh
npx sv@latest create remult-sveltekit-todo
```

The command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app project. Here are the answers used in this tutorial:

1. **Which Svelte app template?**: ... `minimal` Project
2. **Add type checking with TypeScript?** ... Yes, using `TypeScript` syntax
3. **Select additional options**: ... We didn't select anything for this tutorial. Feel free to adapt it to your needs.
4. **Which package manager?**: ... We took `npm`, if you perfer others, feel free.

Once completed, change to the app directory:

```sh
cd remult-sveltekit-todo
```

### Install required packages and Remult

```sh
npm i remult --save-dev
```

### Bootstrap Remult

1. Open your IDE.

2. Create your remult `api`

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultSveltekit } from 'remult/remult-sveltekit'

export const api = remultSveltekit({})
```

:::

3. Create a remult `api route`

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/api/[...remult]/+server.ts]
import { api } from '../../../server/api'

export const { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE } = api
```

:::

### Final tweaks

Our full stack starter project is almost ready.

Remult makes use of decorators to enhance regular Typescript classes into entities. Add the following entry to the `compilerOptions` section of the `tsconfig.json` file to enable the use of decorators.

::: code-group

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true // [!code ++]
  }
}
```

:::

### Run the app

Open a terminal and start the vite dev server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The default "Sveltekit" app main screen should be available at the default Vite dev server address http://localhost:5173.

### Setup completed

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.



# SvelteKit - Tutorial - Entities

# Entities

Let's start coding the app by defining the `Task` entity class.

The `Task` entity class will be used:

- As a model class for client-side code
- As a model class for server-side code
- By `remult` to generate API endpoints, API queries, and database commands

The `Task` entity class we're creating will have an auto-generated `id` field, a `title` field, a `completed` field and an auto-generated `createdAt` field. The entity's API route ("tasks") will include endpoints for all `CRUD` operations.

## Define the Model

1. Create a `shared` folder under the `src` folder. This folder will contain code shared between the frontend and the backend.

2. Create a file `Task.ts` in the `src/shared/` folder, with the following code:

::: code-group

```ts [src/shared/Task.ts]
import { Entity, Fields } from 'remult'

@Entity('tasks', {
  allowApiCrud: true,
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id!: string

  @Fields.string()
  title: string = ''

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed: boolean = false

  @Fields.createdAt()
  createdAt?: Date
}
```

:::

The [@Entity](../../docs/ref_entity.md) decorator tells Remult that this class is an entity class. The decorator accepts a `key` argument (used to name the API route and as the default database collection/table name), and an optional `options` object of type `EntityOptions`. This is used to define entity-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial.

Initially, we are going to allow all CRUD operations on tasks, by setting the option [allowApiCrud](../../docs/ref_entity.md#allowapicrud) to `true`.

The [@Fields.cuid](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-cuid) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a short random id using the [cuid](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid) library. This value can't be changed after the entity is created.

The [@Fields.string](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-string) decorator tells Remult the `title` property is an entity data field of type `String`. This decorator is also used to define field-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial and the same goes for `@Fields.boolean` and the `completed` property.

The [@Fields.createdAt](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-createdat) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a `createdAt` field with the current date and time.

::: tip
For a complete list of supported field types, see the [Field Types](../../docs/field-types.md) section in the Remult documentation.
:::

3. Register the `Task` entity with Remult by adding `entities: [Task]` to the `options` object that is passed to the remult hook:

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultSveltekit } from 'remult/remult-sveltekit'
import { Task } from '../shared/Task' // [!code ++]

export const _api = remultSveltekit({
  entities: [Task], // [!code ++]
})
```

:::

## Test the API

Now that the `Task` entity is defined, we can start using the REST API to query and add tasks. By default Remult exposes the `/api/` endpoint. Resources (entities) can then be accessed by appending the entity's `key` -- _tasks_ in this case.

1. Open a browser with the url: [http://localhost:5173/api/tasks](http://localhost:5173/api/tasks), and you'll see that you get an empty array.

2. Use `curl` to `POST` a new task - _Clean car_. If you prefer, you can use a graphical tool such as Postman, Insomnia or Thunder Client.

```sh
curl http://localhost:5173/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"Clean car\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

3. Refresh the browser for the url: [http://localhost:5173/api/tasks](http://localhost:5173/api/tasks) and notice that the array now contains one item.

4. The `POST` endpoint can accept a single `Task` or an array of `Task`s. Add a few more tasks:

```sh
curl http://localhost:5173/api/tasks -d "[{\"title\": \"Read a book\"},{\"title\": \"Take a nap\", \"completed\":true },{\"title\": \"Pay bills\"},{\"title\": \"Do laundry\"}]" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

5. Refresh the browser again, to see that the new tasks were stored in the db.

::: warning Wait, where is the backend database?
While remult supports [many relational and non-relational databases](https://remult.dev/docs/databases.html), in this tutorial we start off by storing entity data in a backend **JSON file**. Notice that a `db` folder has been created under the root folder, with a `tasks.json` file containing the created tasks.
:::

## Admin UI

### Enabling the Admin UI

Add the Admin UI to your Sveltekit application by setting the `admin` option to `true` in the `remultSveltekit()`

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultSveltekit } from 'remult/remult-sveltekit'
import { Task } from '../shared/Task'

export const _api = remultSveltekit({
  entities: [Task],
  admin: true, // Enable the Admin UI
})
```

:::

### Accessing and Using the Admin UI

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/api/admin` to access the Admin UI. Here, you can perform CRUD operations on your entities, view their relationships via the Diagram entry, and ensure secure management with the same validations and authorizations as your application.

![Remult Admin](/remult-admin.png)

### Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Directly create, update, and delete tasks through the Admin UI.
- **Entity Diagram**: Visualize relationships between entities for better data structure understanding.
- **Security**: Operations are secure, adhering to application-defined rules.

## Display the Task List

Let's start developing the web app by displaying the list of existing tasks.

Let's do it simply in the root of the app by adding this code in `+page.svelte`:

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import { repo } from "remult";
  import { Task } from "../shared/Task";

  let tasks = $state<Task[]>([]);

  $effect(() => {
    repo(Task)
      .find()
      .then((t) => (tasks = t));
  });
</script>

<div>
  <h1>todos</h1>
  <main>
    {#each tasks as task}
      <div>
        <input type="checkbox" bind:checked={task.completed} />
        <span>{task.title}</span>
      </div>
    {/each}
  </main>
</div>
```

:::

Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet:

- ` remult.repo(Task)` is a Remult [Repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md) object used to fetch and create Task entity objects.
- `$effect` is used to call the Remult [repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md)'s [find](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method to fetch tasks from the server, once when the component is loaded.

After the browser refreshes, the list of tasks appears.

### Styling the Output

Remult is un-opinionated in as far as front-end styling is concerned. To demonstrate, let's style our app using vanilla CSS.

Simply create these 2 files:

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+layout.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import "../app.css"

  interface Props {
    data: import('./$types').LayoutData;
    children?: import('svelte').Snippet;
  }

  let { data, children }: Props = $props();
</script>

<svelte:head>
  <title>Remult+Sveltekit Todo App</title>
</svelte:head>

{@render children?.()}
```

```css [src/app.css]
@charset "utf-8";

body {
  font-family: Arial;
  background-color: whitesmoke;
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 0;
}

h1 {
  color: #ef4444;
  font-style: italic;
  font-size: 3.75rem;
  font-weight: inherit;
  text-align: center;
}

main {
  max-width: 500px;
  min-width: 300px;
  margin: auto;
  background-color: white;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 1px solid lightgray;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  box-shadow:
    0 2px 4px #0003,
    0 25px 50px #0000001a;
}

main > div,
main > form {
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.25rem;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

main > div:has(input[type='checkbox']) {
  justify-content: inherit;
}

input {
  font-family: inherit;
  font-size: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  border: 0;
  padding: 0.5rem;
}

input:checked + input,
input:checked + span {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}

input:placeholder-shown {
  font-style: italic;
}

input[type='checkbox'] {
  width: 36px;
  height: 36px;
  height: 1.5rem;
}

button {
  cursor: pointer;
  padding: 0.5rem 0.5rem;
  background-color: white;
  font-family: inherit;
  font-size: 85%;
  line-height: inherit;
  border: 2px solid #0000001a;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
```

:::

...and voila!, our app should look much better!! Feel free to improve or substitute the styling as you deem fit.

::: tip
The styles imported into `src/routes/+layout.svelte` will apply to all pages in the app - unless explicitly overriden.

# SvelteKit - Tutorial - Paging, Sorting and Filtering

# Paging, Sorting and Filtering

The RESTful API created by Remult supports **server-side paging, sorting, and filtering**. Let's use that to limit, sort and filter the list of tasks.

## Limit Number of Fetched Tasks

Since our database may eventually contain a lot of tasks, it make sense to use a **paging strategy** to limit the number of tasks retrieved in a single fetch from the back-end database.

Let's limit the number of fetched tasks to `20`.

To do so, simply pass a `limit` option to the `find` method call:

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
$effect(() => {
  repo(Task)
    .find(
      { limit: 20 } // [!code ++]
    )
    .then((t) => (tasks = t));
});
```

:::

Depending on the number of tasks that you have added, you may not have enough tasks in the database for this change to have an immediate visible effect, but it will have one later on when we add more tasks.

::: tip
Using `limit` only returns the first page of data. To query subsequent pages, use the [Repository.find()](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method's `page` option.
:::

## Sorting By Creation Date

We would like old tasks to appear first in the list, and new tasks to appear last. Let's sort the tasks by their `createdAt` field.

Set the `orderBy` property of the `find` method call's `option` argument to an object that contains the fields you want to sort by.
Use "asc" and "desc" to determine the sort order.

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
$effect(() => {
  repo(Task)
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" } // [!code ++]
    })
    .then((t) => (tasks = t));
});
```

:::

## Filtering

Remult supports sending filter rules to the server to query only the tasks that we need.

Adjust your function to fetch only `completed` tasks.

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
$effect(() => {
  repo(Task)
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" },
      where: { completed: true } // [!code ++]
    })
    .then((t) => (tasks = t));
});
```

:::

::: warning NOTE:
Because the `completed` field is of type `boolean`, the argument is **compile-time checked to be of the `boolean` type**. Settings the `completed` filter to `undefined` causes it to be ignored by Remult.
:::

Play with different filtering values, and eventually comment it out, since we do need all the tasks

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte] {6}
$effect(() => {
  repo(Task)
    .find({
        limit: 20,
        orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
        // where: { completed: true }
    })
    .then((t) => (tasks = t));
});
```

::: tip Learn more
Explore the reference for a [comprehensive list of filtering options](../../docs/entityFilter.md).

# SvelteKit - Tutorial - CRUD Operations

# CRUD Operations

## Adding new tasks

Now that we can see the list of tasks, it's time to add a few more. We create a form which executes the `addTask` function that invokes `taskRepo.insert()`. Update your `+page.svelte` as follows:

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]

<script lang="ts">
  import { repo } from "remult";
  import { Task } from "../shared/Task";

  let tasks = $state<Task[]>([]);

  $effect(() => {
    repo(Task)
      .find()
      .then((t) => (tasks = t));
  });

  let newTaskTitle = $state(""); // [!code ++]
  const addTask = async (event: Event) => {// [!code ++]
    event.preventDefault();// [!code ++]
    const newTask = await repo(Task).insert({ title: newTaskTitle });// [!code ++]
    tasks = [...tasks, newTask];// [!code ++]
    newTaskTitle = "";// [!code ++]
  };// [!code ++]
</script>

<div>
  <h1>todos</h1>
  <main>
    <form onsubmit={addTask}>// [!code ++]
      <input bind:value={newTaskTitle} placeholder="What needs to be done?" />// [!code ++]
      <button>Add</button>// [!code ++]
    </form>// [!code ++]

    {#each tasks as task}
      <div>
        <input type="checkbox" bind:checked={task.completed} />
        <span>{task.title}</span>
      </div>
    {/each}
  </main>
</div>

```

:::
The call to `insert` will make a post request to the server, insert the new task to the db, and return the new Task object with all it's info (including the id generated by the database)

Try adding a few tasks to see how it works.

## Mark Tasks as Completed

1. Add a `setCompleted` function in the script section as follows:

```ts
const setCompleted = async (task: Task, completed: boolean) => {
  await repo(Task).save({ ...task, completed })
}
```

2. Modify the checkbox to invoke the method:

```svelte
<div>
	<input
		type="checkbox"
		checked={task.completed}
		oninput={(e) => setCompleted(task, e.currentTarget.checked)}
	/>
	<span>{task.title}</span>
</div>
```

## Rename Tasks

To make the tasks in the list updatable, we'll use an `input` element and bind it to the task's `title` property. We'll also add a _Save_ button to commit the changes to the backend database.

1. Add a `saveTask` function in the script section as follows:

```ts
const saveTask = async (e: Event, task: Task) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  await repo(Task).save({ ...task })
}
```

2. Update the html part

```svelte
{#each tasks as task}
	<div>
		<input
			type="checkbox"
			checked={task.completed}
			oninput={(e) => setCompleted(task, e.currentTarget.checked)}
		/>
		<input name="title" bind:value={task.title} />
		<button onclick={(e) => saveTask(e, task)}>Save</button>
	</div>
{/each}
```

The `saveTask` function saves the task that is passed in. Since the task's title is bound to the `input`, changes are made directly to the task.

Make some changes and refresh the browser to verify that the backend database is updated.

::: tip Browser's Network tab
As you play with these `CRUD` capabilities, monitor the network tab and see that they are all translated to `rest` api calls.
:::

## Delete Tasks

Let's add a _Delete_ button next to the **Save** button of each task in the list.

1. Add the `deleteTask` function

```ts
const deleteTask = async (e: Event, task: Task) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  await repo(Task).delete(task)
  tasks = tasks.filter((c) => c.id !== task.id)
}
```

2. Add the **Delete** button

```svelte
{#each tasks as task}
	<div>
		<input
			type="checkbox"
			checked={task.completed}
			oninput={(e) => setCompleted(task, e.currentTarget.checked)}
		/>
		<input name="title" bind:value={task.title} />
		<button onclick={(e) => saveTask(e, task)}>Save</button>
		<button onclick={(e) => deleteTask(e, task)}>Delete</button> // [!code ++]
	</div>
{/each}
```



# SvelteKit - Tutorial - Validation

# Validation

Validating user input is usually required both on the client-side and on the server-side, often causing a violation of the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) design principle. **With Remult, validation code can be placed within the entity class, and Remult will run the validation logic on both the frontend and the relevant API requests.**

::: warning Handling validation errors

When a validation error occurs, Remult will throw an exception.

In this tutorial, we will catch these exceptions, and alert the user.
:::

## Validate the Title Field

Task titles are required. Let's add a validity check for this rule.

1. In the `Task` entity class, modify the `Fields.string` decorator for the `title` field to include an object literal argument and set the object's `validate` property to `Validators.required`.

::: code-group

```ts [src/shared/Task.ts]
import { Validators } from 'remult';

@Fields.string({
  validate: Validators.required
})
title: string = '';
```

:::

2. In `+page.svelte`, sorround the `addTask` in a `try-catch` block to capture the error:

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
let newTaskTitle = $state("");
const addTask = async (event: Event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  try {// [!code ++]
    const newTask = await repo(Task).insert({ title: newTaskTitle });
    tasks = [...tasks, newTask];
    newTaskTitle = "";
  } catch (error) {// [!code ++]
    alert((error as { message: string }).message);// [!code ++]
  }// [!code ++]
};
```

:::

After the browser is refreshed, try creating a new task or saving an existing one with an empty title - the "**Title: Should not be empty**" error message is displayed.

Sorround all the other functions in `try-catch` in a similar manner and notify the user accordingly.

### Implicit server-side validation

The validation code we've added is called by Remult on the server-side to validate any API calls attempting to modify the `title` field.

Try making the following `POST` http request to the `http://localhost:5173/api/tasks` endpoint, providing an invalid title.

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:5173/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

A HTTP **400 Bad Request** error is returned and the validation error text is included in the body:

```ts
{
  modelState: { title: 'Should not be empty' },
  message: 'Title: Should not be empty'
}
```

::: tip
You should probably update all your code to handle these errors gracefully with `try-catch` blocks.
:::

## Custom Validation

Remult accords you the ability to easly create your own validation rules.

The `validate` property allows an arrow function which accepts an instance of the entity to be validated. This function will be called to validate input on both front-end and back-end.

Try something like this and see what happens:

::: code-group

```ts [src/shared/Task.ts]
@Fields.string<Task>({
  validate: (task) => {
    if (task.title.length < 3) throw "The title must be at least 3 characters long"
  }
})
title = ""
```

# SvelteKit - Tutorial - Live Queries

# Live Queries

Our todo list app can have multiple users using it at the same time. However, changes made by one user are not seen by others unless they manually refresh their browser.

Let's add realtime multiplayer capabilities to this app.

## Realtime updated todo list

Let's update our component like follows _(make sure you add and remove some lines as indicated)_
::: code-group

```svelte [/src/routes/+page.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
	import { repo } from "remult";
	import { Task } from "../shared/Task";

	let tasks = $state<Task[]>([]);

	$effect(() => {
		// repo(Task) // [!code --]
		//   .find() // [!code --]
		//   .then((t) => (tasks = t)); // [!code --]
		return repo(Task) // [!code ++]
			.liveQuery() // [!code ++]
			.subscribe((info) => { // [!code ++]
				tasks = info.applyChanges(tasks); // [!code ++]
			}); // [!code ++]
	});

	let newTaskTitle = $state("");
	const addTask = async (event: Event) => {
		event.preventDefault();
		try {
			const newTask = await repo(Task).insert({ title: newTaskTitle });
			// tasks = [...tasks, newTask];// [!code --]
			newTaskTitle = "";
		} catch (error) {
			alert((error as { message: string }).message);
		}
	};

	const setCompleted = async (task: Task, completed: boolean) => {
		try {
			await repo(Task).save({ ...task, completed });
		} catch (error) {
			alert((error as { message: string }).message);
		}
	};

	const saveTask = async (e: Event, task: Task) => {
		e.preventDefault();
		try {
			await repo(Task).save({ ...task });
		} catch (error) {
			alert((error as { message: string }).message);
		}
	};

	const deleteTask = async (e: Event, task: Task) => {
		try {
			await repo(Task).delete(task);
			// tasks = tasks.filter((c) => c.id !== task.id);// [!code --]
		} catch (error) {
			alert((error as { message: string }).message);
		}
	};
</script>

<div>
	<h1>todos</h1>
	<main>
		<form onsubmit={addTask}>
			<input bind:value={newTaskTitle} placeholder="What needs to be done?" />
			<button>Add</button>
		</form>

		{#each tasks as task}
			<div>
				<input
					type="checkbox"
					checked={task.completed}
					oninput={(e) => setCompleted(task, e.currentTarget.checked)}
				/>
				<!-- <span>{task.title}</span> -->
				<input name="title" bind:value={task.title} />
				<button onclick={(e) => saveTask(e, task)}>Save</button>
				<button onclick={(e) => deleteTask(e, task)}>Delete</button>
			</div>
		{/each}
	</main>
</div>
```

:::
Let's review the change:

- Instead of calling the `repository`'s `find` method we now call the `liveQuery` method to define the query, and then call its `subscribe` method to establish a subscription which will update the Tasks state in realtime.
- The `subscribe` method accepts a callback with an `info` object that has 3 members:
  - `items` - an up to date list of items representing the current result - it's useful for readonly use cases.
  - `applyChanges` - a method that receives an array and applies the changes to it - we send that method to the `setTasks` state function, to apply the changes to the existing `tasks` state.
  - `changes` - a detailed list of changes that were received
- The `subscribe` method returns an `unsubscribe` function, by just returning in the `$effect` function we automatically unsubscribe when the component unmounts. _(You can also do it manually in a `onDestroy` hook)_

- As all relevant CRUD operations (made by all users) will **immediately update the component's state**, we removed the manual adding/removing of new Tasks to the component's state.

Open the todo app in two (or more) browser windows/tabs, make some changes in one window and notice how the others are updated in realtime.

::: tip Under the hood
The default implementation of live-queries uses HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push realtime updates to clients, and stores live-query information in-memory.

For serverless environments _(or multi servers)_, live-query updates can be pushed using integration with third-party realtime providers, such as [Ably](https://ably.com/) (or others), and live-query information can be stored to any database supported by Remult.
:::



# SvelteKit - Tutorial - Backend methods

# Backend methods

When performing operations on multiple entity objects, performance considerations may necessitate running them on the server. **With Remult, moving client-side logic to run on the server is a simple refactoring**.

## Set All Tasks as Un/complete

Let's add two buttons to the todo app: "Set all as completed" and "Set all as uncompleted".

1. Add a `setAllCompleted` async function to `+page.svelte` function component, which accepts a `completed` boolean argument and sets the value of the `completed` field of all the tasks accordingly.

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  // ...
	async function setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
		for (const task of await repo(Task).find()) {
			await repo(Task).save({ ...task, completed });
		}
	}
  // ...
</script>
```

:::

The `for` loop iterates the array of `Task` objects returned from the backend, and saves each task back to the backend with a modified value in the `completed` field.

2. Add the two buttons to the end of the `</main>` section of the markup. Both of the buttons' `on:click` events will call the `setAllCompleted` function with the appropriate value of the `completed` argument.

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
<main>
  <!-- ... -->
  <div>
    <button onclick={() => setAllCompleted(true)}>Mark All Completed</button>
    <button onclick={() => setAllCompleted(false)}>Mark All Incomplete</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

:::

Make sure the buttons are working as expected before moving on to the next step.

## Refactor from Front-end to Back-end

With the current state of the `setAllCompleted` function, each modified task being saved pushes a `PUT` request handled separately by the server. As the number of tasks in the todo list grows, this may become a performance issue. You can verify this on the Network tab of your browser's Developer Tools.

A simple way to prevent this is to expose an API endpoint for `setAllCompleted` requests, and run the same logic on the server instead of the client.

1. Create a new `TasksController` class, in the `shared` folder, and refactor into a new, `static`, `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController` class, which will run on the server.

::: code-group

```ts [src/shared/TasksController.ts]
import { BackendMethod, remult } from 'remult'
import { Task } from './Task'

export class TasksController {
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
    const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task)

    for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
      await taskRepo.update(task.id, { completed })
    }
  }
}
```

:::
The `@BackendMethod` decorator tells Remult to expose the method as an API endpoint (`/api/setAllCompleted`) and allow CRUD operations on this end-point (`{allowed: true}` - more details to follow).

**Unlike the front-end `Remult` object, the server implementation interacts directly with the database.**

2. Register the new `TasksController` class by adding it to the `controllers` array of the `options` object passed to `remultSveltekit()`:

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultSveltekit } from 'remult/remult-sveltekit'
import { Task } from '../shared/Task'
import { TasksController } from '../shared/TasksController' // [!code ++]

export const api = remultSveltekit({
  admin: true,
  entities: [Task], // [!code ++]
  controllers: [TasksController], // [!code ++]
})
```

:::

3.Replace the for iteration in the `setAllCompleted` function of with a call to the `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController`.

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/+page.svelte]
const setAllCompleted = async (completed: boolean) => {
  // for (const task of await repo(Task).find()) { // [!code --]
  //   await repo(Task).save({ ...task, completed });// [!code --]
  // }// [!code --]
  await TasksController.setAllCompleted(completed) // [!code ++]
}
```

:::

::: warning Import TasksController
Remember to add an import of `TasksController` in `+page.svelte`.
:::

::: tip Note
With Remult backend methods, argument types are compile-time checked. :thumbsup:

After the browser is refreshed, the _"Set all..."_ buttons function exactly the same but now makes only a single request to the back, and is faster.



# SvelteKit - Tutorial - Authentication and Authorization

# Authentication and Authorization

Our todo app is nearly functionally complete, but it still doesn't fulfill a very basic requirement - that users should log in before they can view, create or modify tasks.

Remult provides a flexible mechanism that enables placing **code-based authorization rules** at various levels of the application's API. To maintain high code cohesion, **entity and field-level authorization code should be placed in entity classes**.

**Remult is completely unopinionated when it comes to user authentication.** You are free to use any kind of authentication mechanism. The only requirement is that you provide Remult with an object which implements the Remult `UserInfo` interface:

```ts
export interface UserInfo {
  id: string
  name?: string
  roles?: string[]
}
```

In this tutorial, we'll use [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) for authentication.

## Tasks CRUD Requires Sign-in

This rule is implemented within the `Task` `@Entity` decorator, by modifying the value of the `allowApiCrud` property. This property can be set to a function that accepts a `Remult` argument and returns a `boolean` value. Let's use the `Allow.authenticated` function from Remult.

::: code-group

```ts [src/app/shared/Task.ts]
import { Allow } from 'remult'// [!code ++]

@Entity("tasks", {
    allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated // [!code ++]
})
```

After the browser refreshes, **the list of tasks disappears** and the user can no longer create new tasks.

::: details Inspect the HTTP error returned by the API using cURL

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:5173/api/tasks
```

:::

### Server-side Authorization

Open your database (`db/tasks.json`), and click on **Mark All Completed** and **Mark All Incomplete** buttons in turn. You will notice that the `completed` field is toggling.

Although client CRUD requests to `tasks` API endpoints now require a signed-in user, the API endpoint created for our `setAllCompleted` server function remains available to unauthenticated requests. Since the `allowApiCrud` rule we implemented does not affect the server-side code's ability to use the `Task` entity class for performing database CRUD operations, **the `setAllCompleted` function still works as before**.

To fix this, let's implement the same rule using the `@BackendMethod` decorator of the `setAllCompleted` method of `TasksController`.

::: code-group

```ts [src/shared/TasksController.ts]
import { Allow } from 'remult'

@BackendMethod({ allowed: Allow.authenticated })
```

:::

Try toggling the `completed` field and you will notice that we now require to be authenticated - even on the backend.

## User Authentication

Let's set-up `Auth.js` to authenticate users to our app.

### Backend setup

1. Install `auth-core` and `auth-sveltekit`:

   ```sh
   npm i @auth/core @auth/sveltekit -D
   ```

2. `Auth.js` requires a "secret" - a random string used to hash tokens, sign cookies and generate cryptographic keys.

Create a file called `.env.local` at the root of the project, and set the secret `AUTH_SECRET` to a random string.

::: code-group

```bash [.env.local]
AUTH_SECRET=something-secret
```

:::tip
You can use an [online UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) to generate a completely random string
:::

3. In `+hooks.server.ts`, let's create two handles

- `handleAuth` to handle authentication from `Auth.js` with a list of allowed users.
- `handleRemult` to provide the remult context.

Using Sveltekit's `sequence`, we ensure the chain of handles. The results would look like this:

::: code-group

```ts [src/hooks.server.ts]
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks'
import { SvelteKitAuth } from '@auth/sveltekit'
import Credentials from '@auth/sveltekit/providers/credentials'
import { api as handleRemult } from './server/api'
import type { UserInfo } from 'remult'

/**
 * Users that are allowed to log in.
 */
const validUsers: UserInfo[] = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Jane', roles: ['admin'] },
  { id: '2', name: 'Steve' },
]

/**
 * Handle authentication with authjs as an example
 * Based on article at https://authjs.dev/reference/sveltekit
 */
export const { handle: handleAuth } = SvelteKitAuth({
  trustHost: true,
  providers: [
    Credentials({
      credentials: {
        name: {
          placeholder: 'Try Steve or Jane',
        },
      },
      authorize: (info) =>
        validUsers.find((user) => user.name === info?.name) || null,
    }),
  ],
  callbacks: {
    session: ({ session, token }) => ({
      ...session,
      user: validUsers.find((user) => user.id === token?.sub),
    }),
  },
})

export const handle = sequence(
  // 1. Handle authentication
  handleAuth,
  // 2. Handle remult server side
  handleRemult,
)
```

:::

This (very) simplistic approach use Auth.js [Credentials Provider](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/credentials) to authorize users by looking up the user's name in a predefined list of valid users.

We've configured the `session` `callback` to include the user info as part of the session data, so that Remult on the frontend will have the authorization info.

4. Finally, add `getUser` to `remultSveltekit` to tell remult who is connected. Inside this function, you have access to `event`, where the session was set by Auth.js before.

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultSveltekit } from 'remult/remult-sveltekit'
import { Task } from '../shared/Task'
import { TasksController } from '../shared/TasksController'
import type { UserInfo } from 'remult' // [!code ++]

export const api = remultSveltekit({
  admin: true,
  entities: [Task],
  controllers: [TasksController],
  getUser: async (event) => {
    const auth = await event?.locals?.auth() // [!code ++]
    return auth?.user as UserInfo // [!code ++]
  },
})
```

:::

### Frontend setup

1. Create a new `+layout.server.ts` to update `remult.user`

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/+layout.server.ts]
import { remult } from 'remult'
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from './$types'
import { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit'

// will protect every route in the app
export const load = (async () => {
  if (!remult.authenticated()) {
    throw redirect(303, '/auth/signin')
  }
  return {
    user: remult.user,
  }
}) satisfies LayoutServerLoad
```

:::

2. In our front-end (`+layout.svelte`), update the user globally.

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+layout.ts]
<script lang="ts">
  import { remult } from "remult";// [!code ++]
  import "../app.css"

  interface Props {
    data: import('./$types').LayoutData;
    children?: import('svelte').Snippet;
  }

  let { data, children }: Props = $props();

  $effect(() => {// [!code ++]
    remult.user = data.user;// [!code ++]
  });// [!code ++]
</script>

<svelte:head>
  <title>Remult+Sveltekit Todo App</title>
</svelte:head>

{@render children?.()}
```

:::

The todo app now supports signing in and out, with **all access restricted to signed in users only**.

## Role-based Authorization

Usually, not all application users have the same privileges. You will notice that our `UserInfo` contains a `roles` array. Information contained in this array can be used to enforce role-based authorization.

For our todo app we need to enforce the following authorization rules:

- All signed in users can see the list of tasks.
- All signed in users can set specific tasks as `completed`.
- Only users belonging to the `admin` role can create, delete or edit the titles of tasks.

1. Modify the highlighted lines in the `Task` entity class to enforce the three authorization rules above.

::: code-group

```ts [src/shared/Task.ts]
import { Allow, Entity, Fields } from 'remult'

@Entity<Task>('tasks', {
  allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated,
  allowApiInsert: 'admin',
  allowApiDelete: 'admin',
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id!: string

  @Fields.string<Task>({
    validate: (task) => {
      if (task.title.length < 3)
        throw 'The title must be at least 3 characters long'
    },
    allowApiUpdate: 'admin',
  })
  title: string = ''

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed: boolean = false

  @Fields.createdAt()
  completedAt: Date = new Date()
}
```

:::

In our list of users - `usersDB`; we have defined two users - Jane and Steve; with Jane being assigned an `admin` role.

**Sign in to the app alternating between _"Jane"_ and _"Steve"_ to test that the actions restricted to `admin` users are not allowed. :lock:**

## Role-based Authorization on the Frontend

From a user experience perspective it only makes sense that users that can't add or delete, would not see these buttons.

Let's reuse the same definitions on the Frontend.

We'll use the entity's metadata to only show the form if the user is allowed to insert

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]

<main>
  {#if repo(Task).metadata.apiInsertAllowed()}// [!code ++]
    <form onsubmit={addTask}>
      <input bind:value={newTaskTitle} placeholder="What needs to be done?" />
      <button>Add</button>
    </form>
  {/if}// [!code ++]
</main>
```

:::

And let's do the same for the `delete` button:

::: code-group

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
<div>
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    checked={task.completed}
    oninput={(e) => setCompleted(task, e.currentTarget.checked)}
  />
  <!-- <span>{task.title}</span> -->
  <input name="title" bind:value={task.title} />
  <button onclick={(e) => saveTask(e, task)}>Save</button>
  {#if repo(Task).metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(task)} // [!code ++]
    <button onclick={(e) => deleteTask(e, task)}>Delete</button>
  {/if}// [!code ++]
</div>
```

:::

This way we can keep the UI consistent with the `api`'s Authorization rules

- Note We send the `task` to the `apiDeleteAllowed` method, because the `apiDeleteAllowed` option, can be sophisticated and can also be based on the specific item's values.



# SvelteKit - Tutorial - Database

# Database

Up until now the todo app has been using a plain JSON file to store the list of tasks. In production, you will often want to use a proper database. Remult supports a (long) list of relational and non-relational databases. In this tutorial, let's use `Postgres`.

::: tip Learn more
See the [Quickstart](https://remult.dev/docs/quickstart.html#connecting-a-database) article to find out more.
:::

::: warning Don't have Postgres installed? Don't have to.
Don't worry if you don't have Postgres installed locally. In the next step of the tutorial, we'll configure the app to use Postgres in production, and keep using JSON files in our dev environment.

**Simply install `postgres-node` per step 1 below and move on to the [Deployment section of the tutorial](deployment.md).**
:::

1. Install `postgres-node` ("pg").

   ```sh
   npm i pg
   ```

2. Add an environment variables called DATABASE_URL and set it with your connection string:

::: code-group

```sh [.env.local]
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/dbname[?paramspec]
```

:::

3. Add a `dataProvider` to Remult's handler.

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultSveltekit } from 'remult/remult-sveltekit'
import { Task } from './shared/Task'
import { TasksController } from './shared/TasksController'
import { createPostgresDataProvider } from 'remult/postgres' // [!code ++]
import { DATABASE_URL } from '$env/static/private' // [!code ++]

export const _api = remultSveltekit({
  entities: [Task],
  controllers: [TasksController],
  dataProvider: DATABASE_URL // [!code ++]
    ? createPostgresDataProvider({ connectionString: DATABASE_URL }) // [!code ++]
    : undefined, // [!code ++]
  getUser: async (event) => {
    const auth = await event?.locals?.auth()
    return auth?.user as UserInfo
  },
})
```

:::

Once the application restarts, it'll try to use postgres as the data source for your application.

If `DATABASE_URL` is found, it'll automatically create the `tasks` table for you.

If `DATABASE_URL` is not has found, it'll just fallback to our local JSON files.

::: tip
You can also disable this automatic migration behavior. It's not part of this tutorial so if you want to learn more, follow this [link](/docs/migrations).

# SvelteKit - Tutorial - Deployment

# Deployment

Let's deploy the todo app to [railway.app](https://railway.app/).

## Prepare for Production

In order to deploy to a Node.js environment, you need to change Sveltekit's adaptor to `@sveltejs/adapter-node`.

1. Install `adapter-node`:

```sh
npm i @sveltejs/adapter-node --save-dev
```

2. In `svelte.config.js`, change the adapter:

::: code-group

```js [svelte.config.js]
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-auto' // [!code --]
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node' // [!code ++]
```

:::

In order to deploy the todo app to [railway](https://railway.app/) you'll need a `railway` account. You'll also need [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli#npm) installed, and you'll need to login to railway from the cli, using `railway login`.

Click enter multiple times to answer all its questions with the default answer

1. Create a Railway `project`.

   From the terminal in your project folder run:

   ```sh
   railway init
   ```

2. Select `Empty Project`
3. Set a project name.
4. Once it's done add a database by running the following command:
   ```sh
   railway add
   ```
5. Select `postgressql` as the database.
6. Once that's done run the following command to upload the project to railway:
   ```sh
   railway up
   ```
7. got to the `railway` project's site and click on the project
8. Switch to the `settings` tab
9. Under `Environment` click on `Generate Domain`
10. Copy the `generated url`, you'll need it for [NEXTAUTH_URL](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_url) on step 14
11. Switch to the `variables` tab
12. Click on `+ New Variable`, and in the `VARIABLE_NAME` click `Add Reference` and select `DATABASE_URL`
13. Add another variable called `AUTH_SECRET` and set it to a random string, you can use an [online UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)
14. Add another variable called `NEXTAUTH_URL` and set it to the `generated url` which was created on step 10.
15. Wait for railway to finish deploying your changes and Click on the newly generated url to open the app in the browser and you'll see the app live in production. (it may take a few minutes to go live)

::: warning Note
If you run into trouble deploying the app to Railway, try using Railway's [documentation](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/deployments).
:::

That's it - our application is deployed to production, on a node js server

# SvelteKit - Tutorial - Go further / Extra

# SvelteKit

## Create a SvelteKit Project

To create a new SvelteKit project, run the following command:

```sh
npx sv@latest create remult-sveltekit-todo
```

During the setup, answer the prompts as follows:

1. **Which Svelte app template?**: ... `minimal` Project
2. **Add type checking with TypeScript?** ... Yes, using `TypeScript` syntax
3. **Select additional options**: ... We didn't select anything for this tutorial. Feel free to adapt it to your needs.
4. **Which package manager?**: ... We took `npm`, if you perfer others, feel free.

Once the setup is complete, navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd remult-sveltekit-todo
```

## Install Required Packages and Remult

Install Remult and any necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install remult --save-dev
```

## Bootstrap Remult

To set up Remult in your SvelteKit project:

1. Create your remult `api`

::: code-group

```ts [src/server/api.ts]
import { remultSveltekit } from 'remult/remult-sveltekit'

export const api = remultSveltekit({})
```

:::

2. Create a remult `api route`

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/api/[...remult]/+server.ts]
import { api } from '../../../server/api'

export const { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE } = api
```

:::

## Final Tweaks

Remult uses TypeScript decorators to enhance classes into entities. To enable decorators in your SvelteKit project, modify the `tsconfig.json` file by adding the following to the `compilerOptions` section:

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true // [!code ++]
  }
}
```

## Run the App

To start the development server, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Your SvelteKit app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

Your SvelteKit project with Remult is now up and running.

# Extra

## Extra - Remult in other SvelteKit routes

To enable remult across all sveltekit route

::: code-group

```ts [src/hooks.server.ts]
import { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks'
import { api as handleRemult } from './server/api'

export const handle = sequence(
  // Manage your sequence of handlers here
  handleRemult,
)
```

:::

## Extra - Universal load & SSR

To Use remult in ssr `PageLoad` - this will leverage the `event`'s fetch to load data on the server
without reloading it on the frontend, and abiding to all api rules even when it runs on the server

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/+page.ts]
import { remult } from 'remult'
import type { PageLoad } from './$types'

export const load = (async (event) => {
  // Instruct remult to use the special svelte fetch
  // Like this univeral load will work in SSR & CSR
  remult.useFetch(event.fetch)
  return repo(Task).find()
}) satisfies PageLoad
```

:::

::: tip
You can add this in `+layout.ts` as well and all routes **under** will have the correct fetch out of the box.
:::

## Extra - Server load

If you return a remult entity from the `load` function of a `+page.server.ts`,
SvelteKit will complain and show this error:

```bash
Error: Data returned from `load` while rendering / is not serializable:
Cannot stringify arbitrary non-POJOs (data.tasks[0])
```

To fix this, you can use `repo(Entity).toJson()` in the server load function and `repo(Entity).fromJson()` in the .svelte file
to serialize and deserialize well the entity.

::: code-group

```ts [src/routes/+page.server.ts]
import { repo } from 'remult'
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types'
import { Task } from '../demo/todo/Task'

export const load = (async () => {
  const tasks = repo(Task).toJson(await repo(Task).find())
  return {
    tasks,
  }
}) satisfies PageServerLoad
```

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import type { PageData } from "./$types";
  import { Task } from "../demo/todo/Task";
  import { repo } from "remult";

  let { data }: { data: PageData } = $props();

  let tasks = repo(Task).fromJson(data.tasks);
</script>
```

:::

---

#### Since `@sveltejs/kit@2.11.0`, there is a new feature: [Universal-hooks-transport](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/hooks#Universal-hooks-transport)

With this new feature, you can get rid of `repo(Entity).toJson()` and `repo(Entity).fromJson()` thanks to this file: `hooks.ts`.

::: code-group

```ts [src/hooks.ts]
import { repo, type ClassType } from 'remult'
import { Task } from './demo/todo/Task'
import type { Transport } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import { api } from './server/api'

// You can have:
// A/ a local entity array to work only these ones (like here)
//  or
// B/ import a global entity array that will be
//    shared between backend and frontend (not in ./server/api.ts)
const entities = [Task]

export const transport: Transport = {
  remultTransport: {
    encode: (value: any) => {
      for (let index = 0; index < entities.length; index++) {
        const element = entities[index] as ClassType<any>
        if (value instanceof element) {
          return {
            ...repo(element).toJson(value),
            entity_key: repo(element).metadata.key,
          }
        }
      }
    },
    decode: (value: any) => {
      for (let index = 0; index < entities.length; index++) {
        const element = entities[index] as ClassType<any>
        if (value.entity_key === repo(element).metadata.key) {
          return repo(element).fromJson(value)
        }
      }
    },
  },
}
```

```ts [src/routes/+page.server.ts]
import { repo } from 'remult'
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types'
import { Task } from '../demo/todo/Task'

export const load = (async () => {
  // const tasks = repo(Task).toJson(await repo(Task).find()) // [!code --]
  const tasks = await repo(Task).find()
  return {
    tasks,
  }
}) satisfies PageServerLoad
```

```svelte [src/routes/+page.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import type { PageData } from "./$types";
  import { repo } from "remult";

  let { data }: { data: PageData } = $props();

  // let tasks = repo(Task).fromJson(data.tasks) // [!code --]
  let tasks = data.tasks
</script>
```

:::

## Extra - Svelte 5 & Reactivity

Remult is fully compatible with Svelte 5, Rune, and Reactivity.

To take full advantage of it, add this snippet:

::: code-group

```html [src/routes/+layout.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import { Remult } from 'remult'
  import { createSubscriber } from 'svelte/reactivity'

  // To be done once in the application.
  function initRemultSvelteReactivity() {
    Remult.entityRefInit = (x) => {
      let update = () => {}
      let s = createSubscriber((u) => {
        update = u
      })
      x.subscribe({
        reportObserved: () => s(),
        reportChanged: () => update(),
      })
    }
  }
  initRemultSvelteReactivity()
</script>
```

:::

Then you can use `$state`, `$derived` like any other places

::: code-group

```html [src/routes/+page.svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  // Prepare a new task
  let editingTask = $state(repo(Task).create())

  // Check if the form has empty fields
  let formHasEmpty = $derived(!editingTask || editingTask.title.length === 0)

  // Clone the task to edit
  const editTask = async (task: Task) => {
    editingTask = repo(Task).getEntityRef(task).clone()
  }
</script>
```

# Next.js - Tutorial - Setup

# Build a Full-Stack Next.js Application

### Create a simple todo app with Remult using Next.js

In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple app to manage a task list. We'll use `Next.js`, and Remult as our full-stack CRUD framework. For deployment to production, we'll use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and a `PostgreSQL` database.

By the end of the tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Remult and how to use it to accelerate and simplify full stack app development.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with `TypeScript`, `React` and `Next.js`.

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. <!-- consider specifying Node minimum version with npm -->

# Setup for the Tutorial

This tutorial requires setting up a Next.js project and a few lines of code to add Remult.

You can either **use a starter project** to speed things up, or go through the **step-by-step setup**.

## Option 1: Clone the Starter Project

1. Clone the _remult-nextjs-todo_ repository from GitHub and install its dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/remult/nextjs-app-starter.git remult-nextjs-todo
cd remult-nextjs-todo
npm install
```

2. Open your IDE.
3. Open a terminal and run the `dev` npm script.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The default Next.js app main screen should be displayed (except for the styles which were modified for the tutorial).

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.

## Option 2: Step-by-step Setup

### Create a Next.js project

1. Create the new Next.js project.

```sh
npx -y create-next-app@latest remult-nextjs-todo
```

Answer the questions as follows:

```sh
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? ...  Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? ... No
```

2. Go to the created folder.

```sh
cd remult-nextjs-todo
```

### Install Remult

```sh
npm i remult
```

### Bootstrap Remult in the back-end

Remult is bootstrapped in a `Next.js` using a [catch all dynamic API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments), that passes the handling of requests to an object created using the `remultNextApp` function.

1. Open your IDE.

2. In the `src` directory, create a file called `api.ts` with the following code:

   ```ts
   // src/api.ts

   import { remultNextApp } from 'remult/remult-next'

   export const api = remultNextApp({})
   ```

3. Create an `api` directory within the app folder, and inside it, create a `[...remult]` subdirectory. Inside the `app/api/[...remult]` directory, craft a `route.ts` file with the following code. This file functions as a catch all route for the Next.js API route, effectively managing all incoming API requests.

   ```ts
   // src/app/api/[...remult]/route.ts

   import { api } from '../../../api'

   export const { POST, PUT, DELETE, GET } = api
   ```

### Enable TypeScript decorators

Add the following entry to the `compilerOptions` section of the `tsconfig.json` file to enable the use of decorators in the React app.

```json{7}
// tsconfig.json

{
...
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "experimentalDecorators": true // add this
   ...
  }
...
}

```

### Run the app

Open a terminal and start the app.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The default `Next.js` main screen should be displayed.

### Remove Next.js default styles

The Next.js default styles won't fit our todo app. If you'd like a nice-looking app, replace the contents of `app/globals.css` with [this CSS file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remult/nextjs-app-starter/main/src/app/globals.css). Otherwise, you can simply **delete the contents of `app/globals.css`**.

### Setup completed

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.



# Next.js - Tutorial - Entities

# Entities

Let's start coding the app by defining the `Task` entity class.

The `Task` entity class will be used:

- As a model class for client-side code
- As a model class for server-side code
- By `remult` to generate API endpoints, API queries, and database commands

The `Task` entity class we're creating will have an auto-generated `id` field, a `title` field, a `completed` field and an auto-generated `createdAt` field. The entity's API route ("tasks") will include endpoints for all `CRUD` operations.

## Define the Model

1. Create a `shared` folder under the `src` folder. This folder will contain code shared between frontend and backend.

2. Create a file `Task.ts` in the `shared/` folder, with the following code:

```ts
// src/shared/Task.ts

import { Entity, Fields } from 'remult'

@Entity('tasks', {
  allowApiCrud: true,
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''

  @Fields.string()
  title = ''

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false

  @Fields.createdAt()
  createdAt?: Date
}
```

3. In the `src/api.ts` api route, register the `Task` entity with Remult by adding `entities: [Task]` to an `options` object you pass to the `remultNextApp()` function:

```ts{4,7}
// src/api.ts

import { remultNextApp } from "remult/remult-next"
import { Task } from "./shared/Task"

const api = remultNextApp({
  entities: [Task]
})

export const { POST, PUT, DELETE, GET } = api

```

The [@Entity](../../docs/ref_entity.md) decorator tells Remult this class is an entity class. The decorator accepts a `key` argument (used to name the API route and as a default database collection/table name), and an `options` argument used to define entity-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial.

To initially allow all CRUD operations for tasks, we set the option [allowApiCrud](../../docs/ref_entity.md#allowapicrud) to `true`.

The [@Fields.cuid](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-cuid) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a short random id using the [cuid](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid) library. This value can't be changed after the entity is created.

The [@Fields.string](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-string) decorator tells Remult the `title` property is an entity data field of type `String`. This decorator is also used to define field-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial and the same goes for `@Fields.boolean` and the `completed` property.

The [@Fields.createdAt](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-createdat) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a `createdAt` field with the current date and time.

::: tip
For a complete list of supported field types, see the [Field Types](../../docs/field-types.md) section in the Remult documentation.
:::

## Test the API

Now that the `Task` entity is defined, we can start using the REST API to query and add a tasks.

1. Open a browser with the url: [http://localhost:3000/api/tasks](http://localhost:3000/api/tasks), and you'll see that you get an empty array.

2. Use `curl` to `POST` a new task - _Clean car_.

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"Clean car\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

3. Refresh the browser for the url: [http://localhost:3000/api/tasks](http://localhost:3000/api/tasks) and see that the array now contains one item.

4. Use `curl` to `POST` a few more tasks:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks -d "[{\"title\": \"Read a book\"},{\"title\": \"Take a nap\", \"completed\":true },{\"title\": \"Pay bills\"},{\"title\": \"Do laundry\"}]" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

- Note that the `POST` endpoint can accept a single `Task` or an array of `Task`s.

5. Refresh the browser again, to see that the tasks were stored in the db.

::: warning Wait, where is the backend database?
While remult supports [many relational and non-relational databases](https://remult.dev/docs/databases.html), in this tutorial we start by storing entity data in a backend **JSON file**. Notice that a `db` folder has been created under the root folder, with a `tasks.json` file containing the created tasks.
:::

## Admin UI

### Enabling the Admin UI

Add the Admin UI to your Next.js application by setting the `admin` option to `true` in the `remultNextApp()`

::: code-group

```ts [src/api.ts]
import { remultNextApp } from 'remult/remult-next'
import { Task } from './shared/Task'

const api = remultNextApp({
  entities: [Task],
  admin: true,
})

export const { POST, PUT, DELETE, GET } = api
```

:::

### Accessing and Using the Admin UI

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/admin` to access the Admin UI. Here, you can perform CRUD operations on your entities, view their relationships via the Diagram entry, and ensure secure management with the same validations and authorizations as your application.

![Remult Admin](/remult-admin.png)

### Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Directly create, update, and delete tasks through the Admin UI.
- **Entity Diagram**: Visualize relationships between entities for better data structure understanding.
- **Security**: Operations are secure, adhering to application-defined rules.

## Display the Task List

Let's start developing the web app by displaying the list of existing tasks in a React component.

In the `src` folder create a `components` folder and in it create a `todo.tsx` file and place the following code in it:

```tsx
// src/components/todo.tsx

'use client'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { remult } from 'remult'
import { Task } from '../shared/Task'

const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task)

export default function Todo() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([])

  useEffect(() => {
    taskRepo.find().then(setTasks)
  }, [])
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todos</h1>
      <main>
        {tasks.map((task) => {
          return (
            <div key={task.id}>
              <input type="checkbox" checked={task.completed} />
              {task.title}
            </div>
          )
        })}
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet:

- `taskRepo` is a Remult [Repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md) object used to fetch and create Task entity objects.
- `tasks` is a Task array React state to hold the list of tasks.
- React's useEffect hook is used to call the Remult [repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md)'s [find](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method to fetch tasks from the server once when the React component is loaded.

### Display the todo Component

Replace the contents of `src/app/page.tsx` with the following code:

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx

import Todo from '../components/todo'

export default function Home() {
  return <Todo />
}
```

After the browser refreshes, the list of tasks appears.



# Next.js - Tutorial - Paging, Sorting and Filtering

# Paging, Sorting and Filtering

The RESTful API created by Remult supports **server-side paging, sorting, and filtering**. Let's use that to limit, sort and filter the list of tasks.

## Limit Number of Fetched Tasks

Since our database may eventually contain a lot of tasks, it make sense to use a **paging strategy** to limit the number of tasks retrieved in a single fetch from the back-end database.

Let's limit the number of fetched tasks to `20`.

In the `useEffect` hook defined in the `Todo` component, pass an `options` argument to the `find` method call and set its `limit` property to 20.

```ts{9-13}
// src/components/todo.tsx

//...

export default function Todo() {
  //...

  useEffect(() => {
    taskRepo
      .find({
        limit: 20
      })
      .then(setTasks)
  }, [])

  //...
}
```

There aren't enough tasks in the database for this change to have an immediate effect, but it will have one later on when we'll add more tasks.

::: tip
To query subsequent pages, use the [Repository.find()](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method's `page` option.
:::

## Sorting By Creation Date

We would like old tasks to appear first in the list, and new tasks to appear last. Let's sort the tasks by their `createdAt` field.

In the `useEffect` hook, set the `orderBy` property of the `find` method call's `option` argument to an object that contains the fields you want to sort by.
Use "asc" and "desc" to determine the sort order.

```ts{7}
// src/components/todo.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
    })
    .then(setTasks)
}, [])
```

## Server Side Filtering

Remult supports sending filter rules to the server to query only the tasks that we need.

Adjust the `useEffect` hook to fetch only `completed` tasks.

```ts{8}
// src/components/todo.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" },
      where: { completed: true }
    })
    .then(setTasks)
}, [])
```

::: warning Note
Because the `completed` field is of type `boolean`, the argument is **compile-time checked to be of the `boolean` type**. Setting the `completed` filter to `undefined` causes it to be ignored by Remult.
:::

Play with different filtering values, and eventually comment it out, since we do need all the tasks

```ts{6}
  useEffect(() => {
    taskRepo
      .find({
        limit: 20,
        orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" },
        //where: { completed: true },
      })
      .then(setTasks);
  }, []);
```

::: tip Learn more

# Next.js - Tutorial - CRUD Operations

# CRUD Operations

## Adding new tasks

Now that we can see the list of tasks, it's time to add a few more.

Add the highlighted `newTaskTitle` state and `addTask` function the Home Component

```ts{5-16}
// src/components/todo.tsx

export default function Todo() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([])
  const [newTaskTitle, setNewTaskTitle] = useState("")

  const addTask = async (e: FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    try {
      const newTask = await taskRepo.insert({ title: newTaskTitle })
      setTasks([...tasks, newTask])
      setNewTaskTitle("")
    } catch (error: unknown) {
      alert((error as { message: string }).message)
    }
  }
  //...
```

- the call to `taskRepo.insert` will make a post request to the server, insert the new task to the `db`, and return the new `Task` object with all it's info (including the id generated by the database)

::: warning Import FormEvent
This code requires adding an import of `FormEvent` from `react`.
:::

Next let's adjust the `tsx` to display a form to add new tasks

```tsx{7-14}
// src/components/todo.tsx

return (
  <div>
    <h1>Todos</h1>
    <main>
      <form onSubmit={addTask}>
        <input
          value={newTaskTitle}
          placeholder="What needs to be done?"
          onChange={e => setNewTaskTitle(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button>Add</button>
      </form>
      {tasks.map(task => {
        return (
          <div key={task.id}>
            <input type="checkbox" checked={task.completed} />
            {task.title}
          </div>
        )
      })}
    </main>
  </div>
)
```

Try adding a few tasks to see how it works

## Mark Tasks as completed

Modify the contents of the `tasks.map` iteration within the `Todo` component to include the following `setCompleted` function and call it in the input's `onChange` event.

```tsx{5-6,8-9,16}
// src/components/todo.tsx

{
  tasks.map(task => {
    const setTask = (value: Task) =>
      setTasks(tasks => tasks.map(t => (t === task ? value : t)))

    const setCompleted = async (completed: boolean) =>
      setTask(await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed }))

    return (
      <div key={task.id}>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={task.completed}
          onChange={e => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
        />
        {task.title}
      </div>
    )
  })
}
```

- The `setTask` function is used to replace the state of the changed task in the `tasks` array
- The `taskRepo.save` method update the `task` to the server and returns the updated value

## Rename Tasks and Save them

To make the tasks in the list updatable, we'll bind the `tasks` React state to `input` elements and add a _Save_ button to save the changes to the backend database.

Modify the contents of the `tasks.map` iteration within the `Todo` component to include the following `setTitle` and `saveTask` functions and add an `input` and a save `button`.

```tsx{11,13-19,28-29}
// src/components/todo.tsx

{
  tasks.map(task => {
    const setTask = (value: Task) =>
      setTasks(tasks => tasks.map(t => (t === task ? value : t)))

    const setCompleted = async (completed: boolean) =>
      setTask(await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed }))

    const setTitle = (title: string) => setTask({ ...task, title })

    const saveTask = async () => {
      try {
        setTask(await taskRepo.save(task))
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    return (
      <div key={task.id}>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={task.completed}
          onChange={e => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
        />
        <input value={task.title} onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)} />
        <button onClick={saveTask}>Save</button>
      </div>
    )
  })
}
```

- The `setTitle` function, called from the `input`'s `onChange` event, saves the value from the `input` to the `tasks` state.
- The `saveTask` function, called from the `button`'s' `onClick`event , saves the `task` object to the backend.

Make some changes and refresh the browser to verify the backend database is updated.

::: tip Browser's Network tab
As you play with these `CRUD` capabilities, monitor the network tab and see that they are all translated to `rest` api calls.
:::

## Delete Tasks

Let's add a _Delete_ button next to the _Save_ button of each task in the list.

Add the highlighted `deleteTask` function and _Delete_ `button` Within the `tasks.map` iteration in the `return` section of the `Todo` component.

```tsx{21-28,39}
// src/components/todo.tsx

{
  tasks.map(task => {
    const setTask = (value: Task) =>
      setTasks(tasks => tasks.map(t => (t === task ? value : t)))

    const setCompleted = async (completed: boolean) =>
      setTask(await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed }))

    const setTitle = (title: string) => setTask({ ...task, title })

    const saveTask = async () => {
      try {
        setTask(await taskRepo.save(task))
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    const deleteTask = async () => {
      try {
        await taskRepo.delete(task)
        setTasks(tasks.filter(t => t !== task))
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    return (
      <div key={task.id}>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={task.completed}
          onChange={e => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
        />
        <input value={task.title} onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)} />
        <button onClick={saveTask}>Save</button>
        <button onClick={deleteTask}>Delete</button>
      </div>
    )
  })
}
```



# Next.js - Tutorial - Validation

# Validation

Validating user entered data is usually required both on the client-side and on the server-side, often causing a violation of the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) design principle. **With Remult, validation code can be placed within the entity class, and Remult will run the validation logic on both the frontend and the relevant API requests.**

::: warning Handling validation errors

When a validation error occurs, Remult will throw an exception. 

In this tutorial, [CRUD operations](crud.md) catch these exceptions, and alert the user.
We leave it to you to decide how to handle validation errors in your application.
:::

## Validate the Title Field

Task titles are required. Let's add a validity check for this rule.

1. In the `Task` entity class, modify the `Fields.string` decorator for the `title` field to include an object literal argument and set the object's `validate` property to `Validators.required`.

```ts{3-5}
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Fields.string({
  validate: Validators.required
})
title = ""
```

::: warning Import Validators
This code requires adding an import of `Validators` from `remult`.
:::

::: warning Manual browser refresh required
For this change to take effect, you **must manually refresh the browser**.
:::

After the browser is refreshed, try creating a new `task` or saving an existing one with an empty title - the _"Should not be empty"_ error message is displayed.

### Implicit server-side validation

The validation code we've added is called by Remult on the server-side to validate any API calls attempting to modify the `title` field.

Try making the following `POST` http request to the `http://localhost:3000/api/tasks` API route, providing an invalid title.

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

An http error is returned and the validation error text is included in the response body,

## Custom Validation

The `validate` property of the first argument of `Remult` field decorators can be set to an arrow function which will be called to validate input on both front-end and back-end.

Try something like this and see what happens:

```ts
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Fields.string<Task>({
  validate: (task) => {
    if (task.title.length < 3) throw "Too Short"
  }
})
title = ""
```



# Next.js - Tutorial - Live Queries

# Live Queries :rocket:

::: tip New Feature
Live queries are a new feature introduced in version 0.18.
:::

Our todo list app can have multiple users using it at the same time. However, changes made by one user are not seen by others unless they manually refresh the browser.

Let's add realtime multiplayer capabilities to this app.

## Realtime updated todo list

Let's switch from fetching Tasks once when the React component is loaded, and manually maintaining state for CRUD operations, to using a realtime updated live query subscription **for both initial data fetching and subsequent state changes**.

1. Modify the contents of the `useEffect` hook in the `src/components/todo.tsx` file

```ts{4-5,10}
// src/components/todo.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  return taskRepo
    .liveQuery({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
      //where: { completed: true },
    })
    .subscribe(info => setTasks(info.applyChanges))
}, [])
```

Let's review the change:

- Instead of calling the `repository`'s `find` method we now call the `liveQuery` method to define the query, and then call its `subscribe` method to establish a subscription which will update the Tasks state in realtime.
- The `subscribe` method accepts a callback with an `info` object that has 3 members:
  - `items` - an up to date list of items representing the current result - it's useful for readonly use cases.
  - `applyChanges` - a method that receives an array and applies the changes to it - we send that method to the `setTasks` state function, to apply the changes to the existing `tasks` state.
  - `changes` - a detailed list of changes that were received
- The `subscribe` method returns an `unsubscribe` function which we use as a return value for the `useEffect` hook, so that it'll be called when the component unmounts.

2. As all relevant CRUD operations (made by all users) will **immediately update the component's state**, we should remove the manual adding of new Tasks to the component's state:

```ts{7}
// src/components/todo.tsx

const addTask = async (e: FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  try {
    await taskRepo.insert({ title: newTaskTitle })
    // ^ this no longer needs to be a variable as we are not using it to set the state.
    // setTasks([...tasks, newTask])   <-- this line is no longer needed
    setNewTaskTitle("")
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    alert((error as { message: string }).message)
  }
}
```

3. Optionally remove other redundant state changing code:

```tsx{11-12,18-19,28}
// src/components/todo.tsx

//...

{
  tasks.map(task => {
    const setTask = (value: Task) =>
      setTasks(tasks => tasks.map(t => (t === task ? value : t)))

    const setCompleted = async (completed: boolean) =>
      // setTask(await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })) <- Delete this line
      await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed }) // <- replace with this line

    const setTitle = (title: string) => setTask({ ...task, title })

    const saveTask = async () => {
      try {
        // setTask(await taskRepo.save(task)) <- Delete this line
        await taskRepo.save(task) // <- replace with this line
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    const deleteTask = async () => {
      try {
        await taskRepo.delete(task)
        // setTasks(tasks.filter(t => t !== task)) <- Delete this line
      } catch (error: unknown) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    //...
  })
}
```

Open the todo app in two (or more) browser windows/tabs, make some changes in one window and notice how the others are updated in realtime.

::: tip Under the hood
The default implementation of live-queries uses HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push realtime updates to clients, and stores live-query information in-memory.
Check the browser's network tab, you'll see a call to the `/api/stream` route which receives messages on every update.

For serverless environments _(or multi servers)_, live-query updates can be pushed using integration with third-party realtime providers, such as [Ably](https://ably.com/) (or others), and live-query information can be stored to any database supported by Remult.
:::



# Next.js - Tutorial - Backend methods

# Backend methods

When performing operations on multiple entity objects, performance considerations may necessitate running them on the server. **With Remult, moving client-side logic to run on the server is a simple refactoring**.

## Set All Tasks as Un/completed

Let's add two buttons to the todo app: "Set all as completed" and "Set all as uncompleted".

1. Add a `setAllCompleted` async function to the `Todo` function component, which accepts a `completed` boolean argument and sets the value of the `completed` field of all the tasks accordingly.

   ```ts
   // src/components/todo.tsx

   const setAllCompleted = async (completed: boolean) => {
     for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
       await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
     }
   }
   ```

   The `for` loop iterates the array of `Task` objects returned from the backend, and saves each task back to the backend with a modified value in the `completed` field.

2. Add the two buttons to the return section of the `Todo` component, just before the closing `</main>` tag. Both of the buttons' `onClick` events will call the `setAllCompleted` method with the appropriate value of the `completed` argument.

   ```tsx
   // src/components/todo.tsx

   <div>
     <button onClick={() => setAllCompleted(true)}>Set All Completed</button>
     <button onClick={() => setAllCompleted(false)}>Set All Uncompleted</button>
   </div>
   ```

Make sure the buttons are working as expected before moving on to the next step.

## Refactor from Front-end to Back-end

With the current state of the `setAllCompleted` function, each modified task being saved causes an API `PUT` request handled separately by the server. As the number of tasks in the todo list grows, this may become a performance issue.

A simple way to prevent this is to expose an API endpoint for `setAllCompleted` requests, and run the same logic on the server instead of the client.

1. Create a new `TasksController` class, in the `shared` folder, and refactor the `for` loop from the `setAllCompleted` function of the `Todo` function component into a new, `static`, `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController` class, which will run on the server.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

import { BackendMethod, remult } from 'remult'
import { Task } from './Task'

export class TasksController {
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
    const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task)

    for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
      await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
    }
  }
}
```

The `@BackendMethod` decorator tells Remult to expose the method as an API endpoint (the `allowed` property will be discussed later on in this tutorial).

**Unlike the front-end `Remult` object, the server implementation interacts directly with the database.**

2. Register `TasksController` by adding it to the `controllers` array of the `options` object passed to `createRemultServer()`, in the server's `api` module:

```ts{4,8}
// src/api.ts

//...
import { TasksController } from "./shared/TaskController"

export const api = remultNextApp({
  //...
  controllers: [TasksController]
})
```

3. Replace the `for` iteration in the `setAllCompleted` function of the `Todo` component with a call to the `setAllCompleted` method in the `TasksController`.

```tsx{4}
// src/components/todo.tsx

const setAllCompleted = async (completed: boolean) => {
  await TasksController.setAllCompleted(completed)
}
```

::: warning Import TasksController
Remember to add an import of `TasksController` in `src/components/todo.tsx`.
:::

::: tip Note
With Remult backend methods, argument types are compile-time checked. :thumbsup:
:::

After the browser refreshed, the _"Set all..."_ buttons function exactly the same, but much faster.



# Next.js - Tutorial - Authentication and Authorization

# Authentication and Authorization

Our todo app is nearly functionally complete, but it still doesn't fulfill a very basic requirement - that users should log in before they can view, create or modify tasks.

Remult provides a flexible mechanism that enables placing **code-based authorization rules** at various levels of the application's API. To maintain high code cohesion, **entity and field-level authorization code should be placed in entity classes**.

**Remult is completely unopinionated when it comes to user authentication.** You are free to use any kind of authentication mechanism, and only required to provide Remult with an object which implements the Remult `UserInfo` interface.

In this tutorial, we'll use [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication.

## Tasks CRUD Requires Sign-in

This rule is implemented within the `Task` `@Entity` decorator, by modifying the value of the `allowApiCrud` property.
This property can be set to a function that accepts a `Remult` argument and returns a `boolean` value. Let's use the `Allow.authenticated` function from Remult.

```ts{4}
// src/app/shared/Task.ts

@Entity("tasks", {
    allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated
})
```

::: warning Import Allow
This code requires adding an import of `Allow` from `remult`.
:::

After the browser refreshes, **the list of tasks disappeared** and the user can no longer create new tasks.

::: details Inspect the HTTP error returned by the API using cURL

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/tasks
```

:::

::: danger Authorized server-side code can still modify tasks
Although client CRUD requests to `tasks` API endpoints now require a signed-in user, the API endpoint created for our `setAllCompleted` server function remains available to unauthenticated requests. Since the `allowApiCrud` rule we implemented does not affect the server-side code's ability to use the `Task` entity class for performing database CRUD operations, **the `setAllCompleted` function still works as before**.

To fix this, let's implement the same rule using the `@BackendMethod` decorator of the `setAllCompleted` method of `TasksController`.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

@BackendMethod({ allowed: Allow.authenticated })
```

**This code requires adding an import of `Allow` from `remult`.**
:::

## User Authentication

Let's set-up `NextAuth.js` to authenticate users to our app.

### Backend setup

1. Install `next-auth`:

   ```sh
   npm i next-auth
   ```

2. `NextAuth` requires a "secret" used to encrypt the NextAuth.js JWT, see [Options | NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_secret) for more info.

   Create a file called `.env.local` and set the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to a random string.

   ```
   // .env.local

   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=something-secret
   ```

   :::tip
   you can use an [online UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) to generate a completely random string
   :::

3. Inside the `src` folder, create an `auth.ts` file with the following code.

   ```ts
   // src/auth.ts

   import NextAuth, { getServerSession } from 'next-auth/next'
   import Credentials from 'next-auth/providers/credentials'
   import { UserInfo } from 'remult'

   const validUsers: UserInfo[] = [
     { id: '1', name: 'Jane' },
     { id: '2', name: 'Steve' },
   ]
   function findUser(name?: string | null) {
     return validUsers.find((user) => user.name === name)
   }

   export const auth = NextAuth({
     providers: [
       Credentials({
         credentials: {
           name: {
             placeholder: 'Try Steve or Jane',
           },
         },
         authorize: (credentials) => findUser(credentials?.name) || null,
       }),
     ],
     callbacks: {
       session: ({ session }) => ({
         ...session,
         user: findUser(session.user?.name),
       }),
     },
   })

   export async function getUserOnServer() {
     const session = await getServerSession()
     return findUser(session?.user?.name)
   }
   ```

   This (very) simplistic NextAuth.js [Credentials](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/credentials) authorizes users by looking up the user's name in a predefined list of valid users.

   We've configured the `session` `callback` to include the user info as part of the session info, so that remult on the frontend will have the authorization info.

4. Create an `auth` folder within the 'api' folder, and inside it, create a `[...nextauth]` subdirectory. Inside the `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]` directory, craft a `route.ts` file with the following code.

   ```ts
   // src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts

   import { auth } from '../../../../auth'

   export { auth as GET, auth as POST }
   ```

### Frontend setup

1. Create a `src/components/auth.tsx` file, and place the following code to it:

   ```tsx
   // src/components/auth.tsx

   import { signIn, signOut, useSession } from 'next-auth/react'
   import { useEffect } from 'react'
   import { UserInfo, remult } from 'remult'
   import Todo from './todo'

   export default function Auth() {
     const session = useSession()
     remult.user = session.data?.user as UserInfo

     useEffect(() => {
       if (session.status === 'unauthenticated') signIn()
     }, [session])
     if (session.status !== 'authenticated') return <></>
     return (
       <div>
         Hello {remult.user?.name}{' '}
         <button onClick={() => signOut()}>Sign Out</button>
         <Todo />
       </div>
     )
   }
   ```

2. Update the `src/app/page.tsx` with the highlighted changes:

   ```tsx{3-5,9-11}
   // src/app/page.tsx

   "use client"
   import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react"
   import Auth from "../components/auth"

   export default function Home() {
     return (
       <SessionProvider>
         <Auth />
       </SessionProvider>
     )
   }
   ```

### Connect Remult-Next On the Backend

Once an authentication flow is established, integrating it with Remult in the backend is as simple as providing Remult with a `getUser` function that uses the `getUserOnServer` function we've created in `src/auth.ts`

```ts{3,7}
// src/api.ts

import { getUserOnServer } from "./auth"

const api = remultNextApp({
  //...
  getUser: getUserOnServer,
})
//...
```

The todo app now supports signing in and out, with **all access restricted to signed in users only**.

## Role-based Authorization

Usually, not all application users have the same privileges. Let's define an `admin` role for our todo app, and enforce the following authorization rules:

- All signed in users can see the list of tasks.
- All signed in users can set specific tasks as `completed`.
- Only users belonging to the `admin` role can create, delete or edit the titles of tasks.

1. Modify the highlighted lines in the `Task` entity class to reflect the top three authorization rules.

```ts{7-8,18}
// src/shared/Task.ts

import { Allow, Entity, Fields } from "remult"

@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated,
  allowApiInsert: "admin",
  allowApiDelete: "admin"
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.uuid()
  id!: string

  @Fields.string({
    validate: (task) => {
      if (task.title.length < 3) throw "Too Short"
    }
    allowApiUpdate: "admin"
  })
  title = ""

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false
}
```

2. Let's give the user _"Jane"_ the `admin` role by modifying the `roles` array of her `validUsers` entry.

```ts{4}
// src/auth.ts

const validUsers = [
  { id: "1", name: "Jane", roles: ["admin"] },
  { id: "2", name: "Steve" }
]
```

**Sign in to the app as _"Steve"_ to test that the actions restricted to `admin` users are not allowed. :lock:**

## Role-based Authorization on the Frontend

From a user experience perspective it only makes sense that users that can't add or delete, would not see these buttons.

Let's reuse the same definitions on the Frontend.

We'll use the entity's metadata to only show the form if the user is allowed to insert

```tsx{4,13}
// src/components/todo.tsx

<main>
  {taskRepo.metadata.apiInsertAllowed() && (
    <form onSubmit={addTask}>
      <input
        value={newTaskTitle}
        placeholder="What needs to be done?"
        onChange={e => setNewTaskTitle(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button>Add</button>
    </form>
  )}
  ...
</main>
```

And let's do the same for the `delete` button:

```tsx{12,14}
// src/components/todo.tsx

return (
  <div key={task.id}>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={task.completed}
      onChange={e => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
    />
    <input value={task.title} onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)} />
    <button onClick={saveTask}>Save</button>
    {taskRepo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(task) && (
      <button onClick={deleteTask}>Delete</button>
    )}
  </div>
)
```

This way we can keep the frontend consistent with the `api`'s Authorization rules

- Note We send the `task` to the `apiDeleteAllowed` method, because the `apiDeleteAllowed` option, can be sophisticated and can also be based on the specific item's values.



# Next.js - Tutorial - Database

# Database

Up until now the todo app has been using a plain JSON file to store the list of tasks. **In production, we'd like to use a `Postgres` database table instead.**

::: tip Learn more
See the [Quickstart](https://remult.dev/docs/quickstart.html#connecting-a-database) article for the (long) list of relational and non-relational databases Remult supports.
:::

::: warning Don't have Postgres installed? Don't have to.
Don't worry if you don't have Postgres installed locally. In the next step of the tutorial, we'll configure the app to use Postgres in production, and keep using JSON files in our dev environment.

**Simply install `postgres-node` per step 1 below and move on to the [Deployment section of the tutorial](deployment.md).**
:::

1. Install `postgres-node` ("pg").

   ```sh
   npm i pg
   ```

2. Add an environment variables called `DATABASE_URL` and set it with your connection string

   ```
   // .env.local

   ...
   DATABASE_URL=your connection string
   ```

3. Add the highlighted code to the `api` server module.

   ```ts{5,7,11-13}
   // src/api.ts

   //...

   import { createPostgresDataProvider } from "remult/postgres"

   const DATABASE_URL = process.env["DATABASE_URL"]

   const api = remultNextApp({
     //...
    dataProvider: DATABASE_URL
      ? createPostgresDataProvider({ connectionString: DATABASE_URL })
      : undefined,
   })
   ```

   Once the application restarts, it'll try to use postgres as the data source for your application.

   If `DATABASE_URL` env variable has found, it'll automatically create the `tasks` table for you - as you'll see in the `terminal` window.

   If no `DATABASE_URL` has found, it'll just fallback to our local JSON files.

::: tip Database configurations
You can set more options using the `configuration` property, for example `ssl` and others.

```ts
createPostgresDataProvider({
  configuration: {
    ssl: true,
  },
})
```

:::



# Next.js - Tutorial - Deployment

# Deployment

You can deploy the application to a standard node.js server, or a server-less server.

We'll review both options.

## Deploy to a node.js server

Let's deploy the todo app to [railway.app](https://railway.app/).

In order to deploy the todo app to [railway](https://railway.app/) you'll need a `railway` account. You'll also need [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli#npm) installed, and you'll need to login to railway from the cli, using `railway login`.

Click enter multiple times to answer all its questions with the default answer

1. Create a Railway `project`.

   From the terminal in your project folder run:

   ```sh
   railway init
   ```

2. Select `Empty Project`
3. Set a project name.
4. Once it's done add a database by running the following command:
   ```sh
   railway add
   ```
5. Select `postgressql` as the database.
6. Once that's done run the following command to upload the project to railway:
   ```sh
   railway up
   ```
7. got to the `railway` project's site and click on the project
8. Switch to the `settings` tab
9. Under `Environment` click on `Generate Domain`
10. Copy the `generated url`, you'll need it for [NEXTAUTH_URL](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_url) on step 14
11. Switch to the `variables` tab
12. Click on `+ New Variable`, and in the `VARIABLE_NAME` click `Add Reference` and select `DATABASE_URL`
13. Add another variable called `SESSION_SECRET` and set it to a random string, you can use an [online UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)
14. Add another variable called `NEXTAUTH_URL` and set it to the `generated url` which was created on step 10.
15. Wait for railway to finish deploying your changes and Click on the newly generated url to open the app in the browser and you'll see the app live in production. (it may take a few minutes to go live)

::: warning Note
If you run into trouble deploying the app to Railway, try using Railway's [documentation](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/deployments).
:::

That's it - our application is deployed to production, on a node js server

Next we'll explore deployment to a server-less environment.

## Deploying to a serverless environment

### LiveQuery Serverless Support

Any `serverless` platform can't be used to maintain an active subscription channel for our live query, we'll need to use a 3rd party provider for that.

If you're not using `liveQuery` you can skip to the next step.

In this demo, we'll use [ably.com](https://ably.com/)
Follow these steps only if you want to use `liveQuery` in the app

1. ```sh
   npm i ably
   ```
2. Goto [ably.com](https://ably.com/) create a user and click on the "Create new app" button
3. Select a name and click `create app`
4. Click on the `API Keys` button on top.
5. Copy the first api key (with the many capabilities), create an entry in the `.env.local` file, name it `ABLY_API_KEY` and paste the api key there.
6. Configure `ably` as the `subscriptionServer`

   ```ts{4-5,8-10}
   // src/api.ts

   //...
   import ably from "ably"
   import { AblySubscriptionServer } from "remult/ably"

   const api = remultNextApp({
     subscriptionServer: new AblySubscriptionServer(
       new ably.Rest(process.env["ABLY_API_KEY"]!)
     )
     //...
   })
   ```

7. Next, we'll need to create a route that `ably`'s client on the front-end will use to get a `token` for a user that wants to subscribe to a channel - in the `src/app/api` folder, createa folder called `getAblyToken` and in it create a file called `route.ts`

   ```ts
   // src/app/api/getAblyToken/route.ts

   import ably from 'ably'
   import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

   export async function POST() {
     const token = await new ably.Rest(
       process.env['ABLY_API_KEY']!,
     ).auth.createTokenRequest({ capability: { '*': ['subscribe'] } })
     return NextResponse.json(token)
   }
   ```

8) Configure the `front-end` to use ably as it's `subscriptionClient` by adding a new `useEffect` hook and configure `ably` to use the `api/getAblyToken` route we've created as it's `authUrl` - we'll that in the `Auth` component

   ```tsx{3-4,12-15}
   // src/components/auth.tsx

   import ably from "ably"
   import { AblySubscriptionClient } from "remult/ably"

   export default function Auth() {
     const session = useSession()
     remult.user = session.data?.user as UserInfo

     useEffect(() => {
       if (session.status === "unauthenticated") signIn()
       else if (session.status === "authenticated")
         remult.apiClient.subscriptionClient = new AblySubscriptionClient(
           new ably.Realtime({ authUrl: "/api/getAblyToken", authMethod: "POST" })
         )
     }, [session])
   ```

9) Configure `remultNextApp` to store live-queries in the `dataProvider`

   ```ts{4,6,8-9}
   // src/api.ts

   //...
   import { DataProviderLiveQueryStorage } from "remult/server"

   const dataProvider = createPostgresDataProvider()
   const api = remultNextApp({
     dataProvider,
     liveQueryStorage: new DataProviderLiveQueryStorage(dataProvider)
     //...
   })
   ```

Let's deploy the todo app to [vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Postgres

We'll use vercel's postgres as out database, and that requires the following changes to the `createPostgresDataProvider` options.

```ts{4-7}
// src/api.ts

const dataProvider = createPostgresDataProvider({
  connectionString: process.env["POSTGRES_URL"] || process.env["DATABASE_URL"],
  configuration: {
    ssl: Boolean(process.env["POSTGRES_URL"]),
  },
})
```

- Vercel sends the connection string using the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable, other providers use the `DATABASE_URL` - this code supports them both.
- Ssl is required with vercel - by my local pg doesn't, so we condition ssl based on the environment variable.

### Create a github repo

Vercel deploys automatically whenever you push to github, so the first step of deployment is to create a github repo and push all your changes to it.

### Create a vercel project

1. Create a vercel account if you don't already have one.
2. Goto [https://vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Select your `github` repo and click `import`
4. Configure the project's name and in the `> Environment Variables` section, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `ABLY_API_KEY` environment variables
5. Click `Deploy`
6. Now we need to define the postgres database.
7. Wait for vercel to complete it's deployment
8. Click on `Continue to Dashboard`
9. Select the `Storage` tab
10. Create new Database and select Postgres
11. Accept the terms
12. Select region and click Create & continue
13. Click Connect
14. Click on Settings, Environment Variables and see that the `POSTGRES_URL` and other environment variables were added.
15. At the time of this article, vercel did not yet automatically redeploy once you configure a database, so in order to redeploy, click on the `Deployments` tab
16. 3 dots at the end of the deployment line and select `Redeploy` and click `Redeploy`
17. Once completed click on 'Visit'.

That's it - our application is deployed to production on vercel, play with it and enjoy.

# SolidStart - Tutorial - Setup

# Build a Full-Stack SolidStart Application

### Create a simple todo app with Remult using SolidStart

In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple app to manage a task list. We'll use `SolidStart`, and Remult as our full-stack CRUD framework. For deployment to production, we'll use [railway.app](https://railway.app/) and a `PostgreSQL` database.

By the end of the tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Remult and how to use it to accelerate and simplify full stack app development.

::: tip You want to have a look at the end result ?
You can `degit` the final result and read the `README.md` file in the project to check it out.

```sh
npx degit remult/remult/examples/solid-start-todo remult-solid-start-todo
cd remult-solid-start-todo
```

:::

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with `TypeScript`, `Solid` and `SolidStart`.

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. <!-- consider specifying Node minimum version with npm -->

# Setup for the Tutorial

This tutorial requires setting up a SolidStart project and a few lines of code to add Remult.

You can either **use a starter project** to speed things up, or go through the **step-by-step setup**.

## Option 1: Clone the Starter Project

1. Clone the _remult-solid-start-todo_ repository from GitHub and install its dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/remult/solid-start-app-starter.git remult-solid-start-todo
cd remult-solid-start-todo
npm install
```

2. Open your IDE.
3. Open a terminal and run the `dev` npm script.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The default SolidStart app main screen should be displayed (except for the styles which were modified for the tutorial).

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.

## Option 2: Step-by-step Setup

### Create a SolidStart project

1. Create the new SolidStart project.

```sh
npm init solid@latest remult-solid-start-todo
```

Answer the questions as follows:

```sh
o  Is this a Solid-Start project?
|  Yes
|
o  Which template would you like to use?
|  basic
|
o  Use Typescript?
|  Yes
```

2. Go to the created folder.

```sh
cd remult-solid-start-todo
```

### Install Remult

```sh
npm i remult
```

### Bootstrap Remult in the back-end

Remult is bootstrapped in a `SolidStart` using a [catch all dynamic API route](https://start.solidjs.com/core-concepts/routing#catch-all-routes), that passes the handling of requests to an object created using the `remultSolidStart` function.

1. Open your IDE.

2. Create an `api.ts` file in the `src` folder with the following code - which will have the remult's api configuration.

   ```ts
   // src/api.ts

   import { remultSolidStart } from 'remult/remult-solid-start'

   export const api = remultSolidStart({})
   ```

3. In the `routes` directory within the `src` folder, create an `api` directory. Inside the `src/routes/api/` directory, craft a `[...remult].ts` file with the following code. This file functions as a catch all route for the SolidStart API route, effectively managing all incoming API requests.

   ```ts
   // src/routes/api/[...remult].ts

   import { api } from '../../api.js'

   export const { POST, PUT, DELETE, GET } = api
   ```

### Enable TypeScript decorators

To enable TypeScript decorators:

1. Install the required plugin
   ```sh
   npm i -D @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators @babel/plugin-transform-class-properties
   ```
2. Add the following entry to the `app.config.ts` file to enable the use of decorators in the solid start app.

   ```ts{6-14}
   // app.config.ts

   import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config"

   export default defineConfig({
     //@ts-ignore
     solid: {
       babel: {
         plugins: [
            ["@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators", { version: "legacy" }],
            ["@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties"],
          ],
       },
     },
   })
   ```

### Run the app

Open a terminal and start the app.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The default `SolidStart` main screen should be displayed.

### Cleanup SolidStart basic example

1. Replace the content of `src/app.tsx` with the following code:

   ```tsx
   //src/app.tsx

   import { MetaProvider, Title } from '@solidjs/meta'
   import { Router } from '@solidjs/router'
   import { FileRoutes } from '@solidjs/start/router'
   import { Suspense } from 'solid-js'
   import './app.css'

   export default function App() {
     return (
       <Router
         root={(props) => (
           <MetaProvider>
             <Title>SolidStart - Basic</Title>
             <Suspense>{props.children}</Suspense>
           </MetaProvider>
         )}
       >
         <FileRoutes />
       </Router>
     )
   }
   ```

### Remove SolidStart default styles

The SolidStart default styles won't fit our todo app. If you'd like a nice-looking app, replace the contents of `src/app.css` with [this CSS file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remult/solid-start-app-starter/main/src/app.css). Otherwise, you can simply **delete the contents of `src/app.css`**.

### Setup completed

At this point, our starter project is up and running. We are now ready to move to the [next step of the tutorial](./entities.md) and start creating the task list app.



# SolidStart - Tutorial - Entities

# Entities

Let's start coding the app by defining the `Task` entity class.

The `Task` entity class will be used:

- As a model class for client-side code
- As a model class for server-side code
- By `remult` to generate API endpoints, API queries, and database commands

The `Task` entity class we're creating will have an auto-generated `id` field, a `title` field, a `completed` field and an auto-generated `createdAt` field. The entity's API route ("tasks") will include endpoints for all `CRUD` operations.

## Define the Model

1. Create a `shared` folder under the `src` folder. This folder will contain code shared between frontend and backend.

2. Create a file `Task.ts` in the `shared/` folder, with the following code:

```ts
// src/shared/Task.ts

import { Entity, Fields } from 'remult'

@Entity('tasks', {
  allowApiCrud: true,
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.cuid()
  id = ''

  @Fields.string()
  title = ''

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false

  @Fields.createdAt()
  createdAt?: Date
}
```

3. In the `src/api.ts` file, register the `Task` entity with Remult by adding `entities: [Task]` to an `options` object you pass to the `remultSolidStart()` function:

```ts{4,7}
// src/api.ts

import { remultSolidStart } from "remult/remult-solid-start"
import { Task } from "./shared/Task"

export const api = remultSolidStart({
  entities: [Task]
})
```

The [@Entity](../../docs/ref_entity.md) decorator tells Remult this class is an entity class. The decorator accepts a `key` argument (used to name the API route and as a default database collection/table name), and an `options` argument used to define entity-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial.

To initially allow all CRUD operations for tasks, we set the option [allowApiCrud](../../docs/ref_entity.md#allowapicrud) to `true`.

The [@Fields.cuid](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-cuid) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a short random id using the [cuid](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid) library. This value can't be changed after the entity is created.

The [@Fields.string](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-string) decorator tells Remult the `title` property is an entity data field of type `String`. This decorator is also used to define field-related properties and operations, discussed in the next sections of this tutorial and the same goes for `@Fields.boolean` and the `completed` property.

The [@Fields.createdAt](../../docs/field-types.md#fields-createdat) decorator tells Remult to automatically generate a `createdAt` field with the current date and time.

::: tip
For a complete list of supported field types, see the [Field Types](../../docs/field-types.md) section in the Remult documentation.
:::

## Test the API

Now that the `Task` entity is defined, we can start using the REST API to query and add a tasks.

1. Open a browser with the url: [http://localhost:3000/api/tasks](http://localhost:3000/api/tasks), and you'll see that you get an empty array.

2. Use `curl` to `POST` a new task - _Clean car_.

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"Clean car\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

3. Refresh the browser for the url: [http://localhost:3000/api/tasks](http://localhost:3000/api/tasks) and see that the array now contains one item.

4. Use `curl` to `POST` a few more tasks:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks -d "[{\"title\": \"Read a book\"},{\"title\": \"Take a nap\", \"completed\":true },{\"title\": \"Pay bills\"},{\"title\": \"Do laundry\"}]" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

- Note that the `POST` endpoint can accept a single `Task` or an array of `Task`s.

5. Refresh the browser again, to see that the tasks were stored in the db.

::: warning Wait, where is the backend database?
While remult supports [many relational and non-relational databases](https://remult.dev/docs/databases.html), in this tutorial we start by storing entity data in a backend **JSON file**. Notice that a `db` folder has been created under the root folder, with a `tasks.json` file containing the created tasks.
:::

## Admin UI

### Enabling the Admin UI

Add the Admin UI to your Solid Start application by setting the `admin` option to `true` in the `remultSolidStart()`

::: code-group

```ts [src/api.ts]
import { remultSolidStart } from 'remult/remult-next'
import { Task } from './shared/Task'

export const api = remultSolidStart({
  entities: [Task],
  admin: true, // Enable the Admin UI
})
```

:::

### Accessing and Using the Admin UI

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/admin` to access the Admin UI. Here, you can perform CRUD operations on your entities, view their relationships via the Diagram entry, and ensure secure management with the same validations and authorizations as your application.

![Remult Admin](/remult-admin.png)

### Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Directly create, update, and delete tasks through the Admin UI.
- **Entity Diagram**: Visualize relationships between entities for better data structure understanding.
- **Security**: Operations are secure, adhering to application-defined rules.

## Display the Task List

Let's start developing the web app by displaying the list of existing tasks in a solid component.

In the `src/components` folder create a `Todo.tsx` file and place the following code in it:

Edit the `src/components/Todo.tsx` file

```tsx
// src/components/Todo.tsx

import { repo } from 'remult'
import { createStore } from 'solid-js/store'
import { For, onMount } from 'solid-js'
import { Task } from '../shared/Task.js'

const taskRepo = repo(Task)

export default function Todo() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = createStore<Task[]>([])
  onMount(() => taskRepo.find().then(setTasks))
  return (
    <main>
      <For each={tasks}>
        {(task) => {
          return (
            <div>
              <input type="checkbox" checked={task.completed} />
              {task.title}
            </div>
          )
        }}
      </For>
    </main>
  )
}
```

Here's a quick overview of the different parts of the code snippet:

- `taskRepo` is a Remult [Repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md) object used to fetch and create Task entity objects.
- `tasks` is a Task array solid store to hold the list of tasks.
- solid's onMount hook is used to call the Remult [repository](../../docs/ref_repository.md)'s [find](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method to fetch tasks from the server once when the solid component is loaded.

### Display the todo Component

Replace the contents of `src/routes/index.tsx` with the following code:

```tsx
// src/routes/index.tsx

import Todo from '../components/Todo.jsx'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todos</h1>
      <Todo />
    </div>
  )
}
```

After the browser refreshes, the list of tasks appears.



# SolidStart - Tutorial - Paging, Sorting and Filtering

# Paging, Sorting and Filtering

The RESTful API created by Remult supports **server-side paging, sorting, and filtering**. Let's use that to limit, sort and filter the list of tasks.

## Limit Number of Fetched Tasks

Since our database may eventually contain a lot of tasks, it make sense to use a **paging strategy** to limit the number of tasks retrieved in a single fetch from the back-end database.

Let's limit the number of fetched tasks to `20`.

In the `onMount` hook defined in the `Todo` component, pass an `options` argument to the `find` method call and set its `limit` property to 20.

```ts{11}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

//...

export default function Todo() {
  //...

  onMount(() =>
    taskRepo
      .find({
        limit: 20,
      })
      .then(setTasks)
  )

  //...
}
```

There aren't enough tasks in the database for this change to have an immediate effect, but it will have one later on when we'll add more tasks.

::: tip
To query subsequent pages, use the [Repository.find()](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method's `page` option.
:::

## Sorting By Creation Date

We would like old tasks to appear first in the list, and new tasks to appear last. Let's sort the tasks by their `createdAt` field.

In the `onMount` hook, set the `orderBy` property of the `find` method call's `option` argument to an object that contains the fields you want to sort by.
Use "asc" and "desc" to determine the sort order.

```ts{7}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

onMount(() =>
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
    })
    .then(setTasks)
)
```

## Server Side Filtering

Remult supports sending filter rules to the server to query only the tasks that we need.

Adjust the `onMount` hook to fetch only `completed` tasks.

```ts{8}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

onMount(() =>
  taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" },
      where: { completed: true }
    })
    .then(setTasks)
)
```

::: warning Note
Because the `completed` field is of type `boolean`, the argument is **compile-time checked to be of the `boolean` type**. Setting the `completed` filter to `undefined` causes it to be ignored by Remult.
:::

Play with different filtering values, and eventually comment it out, since we do need all the tasks

```ts{6}
  onMount(() =>
    taskRepo
      .find({
        limit: 20,
        orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" },
        //where: { completed: true },
      })
      .then(setTasks);
  );
```

::: tip Learn more

# SolidStart - Tutorial - CRUD Operations

# CRUD Operations

## Adding new tasks

Now that we can see the list of tasks, it's time to add a few more.

Add the highlighted `newTaskTitle` state and `addTask` function the Home Component

```ts{5-16}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

export default function Todo() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = createStore<Task[]>([])
  const [newTaskTitle, setNewTaskTitle] = createSignal("")

  async function addTask(e: Event) {
    e.preventDefault()
    try {
      const newTask = await taskRepo.insert({ title: newTaskTitle() })
      setTasks([...tasks, newTask])
      setNewTaskTitle("")
    } catch (error) {
      alert((error as { message: string }).message)
    }
  }
  //...
```

::: warning Import createSignal
This code requires adding an import of `createSignal` from `solid-js`.
:::

- the call to `taskRepo.insert` will make a post request to the server, insert the new task to the `db`, and return the new `Task` object with all it's info (including the id generated by the database)

Next let's adjust the `tsx` to display a form to add new tasks

```tsx{5-12}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

return (
  <main>
    <form onSubmit={addTask}>
      <input
        value={newTaskTitle()}
        placeholder="What needs to be done?"
        onInput={(e) => setNewTaskTitle(e.currentTarget.value)}
      />
      <button>Add</button>
    </form>
    <For each={tasks}>
      {(task) => {
        return (
          <div>
            <input type="checkbox" checked={task.completed} />
            {task.title}
          </div>
        )
      }}
    </For>
  </main>
)
```

Try adding a few tasks to see how it works

## Mark Tasks as completed

Modify the contents of the `For` iteration within the `Todo`component to include the following `setCompleted` function and call it in the input's`onInput` event.

```tsx{4-8,14}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

<For each={tasks}>
  {(task, i) => {
    async function setCompleted(completed: boolean) {
      const updatedTask = await taskRepo.update(task, { completed })
      setTasks(i(), updatedTask)
    }
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={task.completed}
          oninput={(e) => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
        />
        {task.title}
      </div>
    )
  }}
</For>
```

- The `taskRepo.update` method updates the `task` to the server and returns the updated value

## Rename Tasks and Save them

To make the tasks in the list updatable, we'll bind the `tasks` solid state to `input` elements and add a _Save_ button to save the changes to the backend database.

Modify the contents of the `For` iteration within the `Todo`component to include the following`setTitle`and`saveTask`functions and add an`input`and a save`button`.

```tsx{9-15,24-28}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

<For each={tasks}>
  {(task, i) => {
    async function setCompleted(completed: boolean) {
      const updatedTask = await taskRepo.update(task, { completed })
      setTasks(i(), updatedTask)
    }
    async function saveTask() {
      try {
        await taskRepo.save(task)
      } catch (error) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={task.completed}
          oninput={(e) => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
        />
        <input
          value={task.title}
          onInput={(e) => setTasks(i(), "title", e.target.value)}
        />
        <button onClick={saveTask}>Save</button>
      </div>
    )
  }}
</For>
```

- The `saveTask` function, called from the `button`'s' `onClick`event , saves the `task` object to the backend.

Make some changes and refresh the browser to verify the backend database is updated.

::: tip Browser's Network tab
As you play with these `CRUD` capabilities, monitor the network tab and see that they are all translated to `rest` api calls.
:::

## Delete Tasks

Let's add a _Delete_ button next to the _Save_ button of each task in the list.

Add the highlighted `deleteTask` function and _Delete_ `button` Within the `For` iteration in the `return` section of the `Todo` component.

```tsx{16-23,36}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

<For each={tasks}>
  {(task, i) => {
    async function setCompleted(completed: boolean) {
      const updatedTask = await taskRepo.update(task, { completed })
      setTasks(i(), updatedTask)
    }
    async function saveTask() {
      try {
        await taskRepo.save(task)
      } catch (error) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }
    async function deleteTask() {
      try {
        await taskRepo.delete(task)
        setTasks(tasks.filter((t) => t !== task))
      } catch (error) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={task.completed}
          oninput={(e) => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
        />
        <input
          value={task.title}
          onInput={(e) => setTasks(i(), "title", e.target.value)}
        />
        <button onClick={saveTask}>Save</button>
        <button onClick={deleteTask}>Delete</button>
      </div>
    )
  }}
</For>
```



# SolidStart - Tutorial - Validation

# Validation

Validating user entered data is usually required both on the client-side and on the server-side, often causing a violation of the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) design principle. **With Remult, validation code can be placed within the entity class, and Remult will run the validation logic on both the frontend and the relevant API requests.**

::: warning Handling validation errors

When a validation error occurs, Remult will throw an exception.

In this tutorial, [CRUD operations](crud.md) catch these exceptions, and alert the user.
We leave it to you to decide how to handle validation errors in your application.
:::

## Validate the Title Field

Task titles are required. Let's add a validity check for this rule.

1. In the `Task` entity class, modify the `Fields.string` decorator for the `title` field to include an object literal argument and set the object's `validate` property to `Validators.required`.

```ts{3-5}
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Fields.string<Task>({
  validate: Validators.required
})
title = ""
```

::: warning Import Validators
This code requires adding an import of `Validators` from `remult`.
:::

After the browser is refreshed, try creating a new `task` or saving an existing one with an empty title - the _"Should not be empty"_ error message is displayed.

### Implicit server-side validation

The validation code we've added is called by Remult on the server-side to validate any API calls attempting to modify the `title` field.

Try making the following `POST` http request to the `http://localhost:3000/api/tasks` API route, providing an invalid title.

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/tasks -d "{\"title\": \"\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

An http error is returned and the validation error text is included in the response body,

## Custom Validation

The `validate` property of the first argument of `Remult` field decorators can be set to an arrow function which will be called to validate input on both front-end and back-end.

Try something like this and see what happens:

```ts
// src/shared/Task.ts

@Fields.string<Task>({
  validate: (task) => task.title.length > 2 || "Too Short",
})
title = ""
```



# SolidStart - Tutorial - Live Queries

# Live Queries :rocket:

Our todo list app can have multiple users using it at the same time. However, changes made by one user are not seen by others unless they manually refresh the browser.

Let's add realtime multiplayer capabilities to this app.

## Realtime updated todo list

Let's switch from fetching Tasks once when the solid component is loaded, and manually maintaining state for CRUD operations, to using a realtime updated live query subscription **for both initial data fetching and subsequent state changes**.

1. Modify the contents of the `onMount` hook in the `src/components/Todo.tsx` file

```ts{4,6,11}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

onMount(() =>
  onCleanup(
    taskRepo
      .liveQuery({
        limit: 20,
        orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" },
        //where: { completed: true },
      })
      .subscribe((info) => setTasks(info.applyChanges))
  )
)
```

Let's review the change:

- Instead of calling the `repository`'s `find` method we now call the `liveQuery` method to define the query, and then call its `subscribe` method to establish a subscription which will update the Tasks state in realtime.
- The `subscribe` method accepts a callback with an `info` object that has 3 members:
  - `items` - an up to date list of items representing the current result - it's useful for readonly use cases.
  - `applyChanges` - a method that receives an array and applies the changes to it - we send that method to the `setTasks` state function, to apply the changes to the existing `tasks` state.
  - `changes` - a detailed list of changes that were received
- The `subscribe` method returns an `unsubscribe` function which we send to the `onCleanup` function, so that it'll be called when the component unmounts.

::: warning Import onCleanup
This code requires adding an import of `onCleanup` from `solid-js`.
:::

2. As all relevant CRUD operations (made by all users) will **immediately update the component's state**, we should remove the manual adding of new Tasks to the component's state:

```ts{7}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

async function addTask(e: Event) {
  e.preventDefault()
  try {
    await taskRepo.insert({ title: newTaskTitle() })
    // ^ this no longer needs to be a variable as we are not using it to set the state.
    // setTasks([...tasks, newTask]) <-- this line is no longer needed
    setNewTaskTitle("")
  } catch (error) {
    alert((error as { message: string }).message)
  }
}
```

3. Optionally remove other redundant state changing code:

```tsx{7-9,21}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

//...
<For each={tasks}>
  {(task, i) => {
    async function setCompleted(completed: boolean) {
      //const updatedTask = await taskRepo.update(task, { completed }) <- Delete this line
      //setTasks(i(), updatedTask) <- Delete this line
      await taskRepo.update(task, { completed }) // <- replace with this line
    }
    async function saveTask() {
      try {
        await taskRepo.save(task)
      } catch (error) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }
    async function deleteTask() {
      try {
        await taskRepo.delete(task)
        // setTasks(tasks.filter((t) => t !== task)) <- Delete this line
      } catch (error) {
        alert((error as { message: string }).message)
      }
    }
```

Open the todo app in two (or more) browser windows/tabs, make some changes in one window and notice how the others are updated in realtime.

::: tip Under the hood
The default implementation of live-queries uses HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push realtime updates to clients, and stores live-query information in-memory.
Check the browser's network tab, you'll see a call to the `/api/stream` route which receives messages on every update.

For serverless environments _(or multi servers)_, live-query updates can be pushed using integration with third-party realtime providers, such as [Ably](https://ably.com/) (or others), and live-query information can be stored to any database supported by Remult.
:::



# SolidStart - Tutorial - Backend methods

# Backend methods

When performing operations on multiple entity objects, performance considerations may necessitate running them on the server. **With Remult, moving client-side logic to run on the server is a simple refactoring**.

## Set All Tasks as Un/completed

Let's add two buttons to the todo app: "Set all as completed" and "Set all as uncompleted".

1. Add a `setAllCompleted` async function to the `Todo` function component, which accepts a `completed` boolean argument and sets the value of the `completed` field of all the tasks accordingly.

   ```ts
   // src/components/Todo.tsx

   async function setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
     for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
       await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
     }
   }
   ```

   The `for` loop iterates the array of `Task` objects returned from the backend, and saves each task back to the backend with a modified value in the `completed` field.

2. Add the two buttons to the return section of the `Todo` component, just before the closing `</main>` tag. Both of the buttons' `onClick` events will call the `setAllCompleted` method with the appropriate value of the `completed` argument.

   ```tsx
   // src/components/Todo.tsx

   <div>
     <button onClick={() => setAllCompleted(true)}>Set All Completed</button>
     <button onClick={() => setAllCompleted(false)}>Set All Uncompleted</button>
   </div>
   ```

Make sure the buttons are working as expected before moving on to the next step.

## Refactor from Front-end to Back-end

With the current state of the `setAllCompleted` function, each modified task being saved causes an API `PUT` request handled separately by the server. As the number of tasks in the todo list grows, this may become a performance issue.

A simple way to prevent this is to expose an API endpoint for `setAllCompleted` requests, and run the same logic on the server instead of the client.

1. Create a new `TasksController` class, in the `shared` folder, and refactor the `for` loop from the `setAllCompleted` function of the `Todo`function component into a new,`static`, `setAllCompleted`method in the`TasksController` class, which will run on the server.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

import { BackendMethod, repo } from 'remult'
import { Task } from './Task'

export class TasksController {
  @BackendMethod({ allowed: true })
  static async setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
    const taskRepo = repo(Task)
    for (const task of await taskRepo.find()) {
      await taskRepo.save({ ...task, completed })
    }
  }
}
```

The `@BackendMethod` decorator tells Remult to expose the method as an API endpoint (the `allowed` property will be discussed later on in this tutorial).

**Unlike the front-end `Remult` object, the server implementation interacts directly with the database.**

2. Register `TasksController` by adding it to the `controllers` array of the `options` object passed to `createRemultServer()`, in the server's `api` module:

```ts{4,8}
// src/api.ts

//...
import { TasksController } from "./shared/TasksController.js"

export const api = remultSolidStart({
  //...
  controllers: [TasksController]
})
```

3. Replace the `for` iteration in the `setAllCompleted` function of the `Todo`component with a call to the`setAllCompleted`method in the`TasksController`.

```tsx{4}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

async function setAllCompleted(completed: boolean) {
  await TasksController.setAllCompleted(completed)
}
```

::: warning Import TasksController
Remember to add an import of `TasksController` in `src/components/Todo.tsx`.
:::

::: tip Note
With Remult backend methods, argument types are compile-time checked. :thumbsup:

After the browser refreshed, the _"Set all..."_ buttons function exactly the same, but much faster.



# SolidStart - Tutorial - Authentication and Authorization

# Authentication and Authorization

Our todo app is nearly functionally complete, but it still doesn't fulfill a very basic requirement - that users should log in before they can view, create or modify tasks.

Remult provides a flexible mechanism that enables placing **code-based authorization rules** at various levels of the application's API. To maintain high code cohesion, **entity and field-level authorization code should be placed in entity classes**.

**Remult is completely unopinionated when it comes to user authentication.** You are free to use any kind of authentication mechanism, and only required to provide Remult with an object which implements the Remult `UserInfo` interface.

In this tutorial, we'll use method outlined in the [Authentication](https://start.solidjs.com/advanced/session/) article of `SolidStart`

## Tasks CRUD Requires Sign-in

This rule is implemented within the `Task` `@Entity` decorator, by modifying the value of the `allowApiCrud` property.
This property can be set to a function that accepts a `Remult` argument and returns a `boolean` value. Let's use the `Allow.authenticated` function from Remult.

```ts{4}
// src/app/shared/Task.ts

@Entity("tasks", {
    allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated
})
```

::: warning Import Allow
This code requires adding an import of `Allow` from `remult`.
:::

After the browser refreshes, **the list of tasks disappeared** and the user can no longer create new tasks.

::: details Inspect the HTTP error returned by the API using cURL

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/tasks
```

:::

::: danger Authorized server-side code can still modify tasks
Although client CRUD requests to `tasks` API endpoints now require a signed-in user, the API endpoint created for our `setAllCompleted` server function remains available to unauthenticated requests. Since the `allowApiCrud` rule we implemented does not affect the server-side code's ability to use the `Task` entity class for performing database CRUD operations, **the `setAllCompleted` function still works as before**.

To fix this, let's implement the same rule using the `@BackendMethod` decorator of the `setAllCompleted` method of `TasksController`.

```ts
// src/shared/TasksController.ts

@BackendMethod({ allowed: Allow.authenticated })
```

**This code requires adding an import of `Allow` from `remult`.**
:::

## User Authentication

Let's set-up `SolidStart` authentication to authenticate users to our app.

### Backend setup

1. Create an `auth.ts` file in the `src` folder with the following code.

   ```ts
   // src/auth.ts

   import { action, redirect } from '@solidjs/router'
   import { useSession } from 'vinxi/http'
   import { type UserInfo } from 'remult'

   const validUsers: UserInfo[] = [
     { id: '1', name: 'Jane' },
     { id: '2', name: 'Steve' },
   ]

   export async function getSession() {
     'use server'
     return await useSession<{ user?: UserInfo }>({
       password:
         process.env['SESSION_SECRET'] ||
         'Something secret used for development only',
     })
   }

   export const loginAction = action(async (formData: FormData) => {
     'use server'
     const username = String(formData.get('username'))
     try {
       const session = await getSession()
       const user = validUsers.find((x) => x.name === username)
       if (!user) throw Error("Invalid user, try 'Steve' or 'Jane'")
       await session.update({ user })
     } catch (err) {
       return err as Error
     }
     throw redirect('/')
   }, 'login')

   export async function logout() {
     'use server'
     const session = await getSession()
     await session.update({ user: null! })
   }

   export async function getUser() {
     'use server'
     const session = await getSession()
     return session?.data?.user
   }
   ```

   - The (very) simplistic `loginAction` endpoint accepts a `FormData` with a `username` property, looks it up in a predefined dictionary of valid users and, if found, sets the user's information to the `user` property of the request's `session`.

   - The `logout` function clears the `user` value from the current session.

   - The `getUser` function extracts the value of the current user from the session and returns it.

2. Create a `src/routes/login.tsx` file, and place the following code to it:

   ```tsx
   // src/routes/login.tsx

   import { useSubmission } from '@solidjs/router'
   import { loginAction } from '../auth.js'
   import { Show } from 'solid-js'

   export default function Home() {
     const sub = useSubmission(loginAction)
     return (
       <>
         <h1>Login</h1>
         <main>
           <form action={loginAction} method="post">
             <input
               type="text"
               name="username"
               placeholder="Username, try Steve or Jane"
             />
             <button>Sign in</button>
           </form>
           <Show when={sub.result?.message}>{sub.result?.message}</Show>
         </main>
       </>
     )
   }
   ```

3. Replace the content of the `src/routes/index.tsx` file with the following code:

   ```tsx
   // src/routes/index.tsx

   import { getUser, logout } from '../auth.js'
   import { useNavigate } from '@solidjs/router'
   import { Show, createSignal, onMount } from 'solid-js'
   import { remult } from 'remult'
   import Todo from '../components/Todo.jsx'

   export default function Home() {
     const [authenticated, setAuthenticated] = createSignal(false)
     const navigate = useNavigate()

     onMount(async () => {
       remult.user = await getUser()
       if (remult.authenticated()) setAuthenticated(true)
       else navigate('/login')
     })

     return (
       <Show when={authenticated()}>
         <h1>Todos</h1>
         <header>
           Hello {remult.user?.name}
           <button
             onClick={async () => logout().then(() => navigate('/login'))}
           >
             Logout
           </button>
         </header>
         <Todo />
       </Show>
     )
   }
   ```

   - We use the `onMount` hook the update the `remult.user` in the `frontend`, based on the user from the current session. That user info can then be used in the front-end for user roles based content

As we were working on this tutorial with the rc version of solid start we got this error - we found that **hard refreshing the site (Ctrl F5) solves it**.
:::

### Connect remult-solid-start On the Backend

Once an authentication flow is established, integrating it with Remult in the backend is as simple as providing Remult with a `getUser` function from the `src/auth.ts`

```ts{3,7}
// src/api.ts

import { getUser } from "./auth.js"

export const api = remultSolidStart({
  //...
  getUser,
})
//...
```

The todo app now supports signing in and out, with **all access restricted to signed in users only**.

## Role-based Authorization

Usually, not all application users have the same privileges. Let's define an `admin` role for our todo app, and enforce the following authorization rules:

- All signed in users can see the list of tasks.
- All signed in users can set specific tasks as `completed`.
- Only users belonging to the `admin` role can create, delete or edit the titles of tasks.

1. Modify the highlighted lines in the `Task` entity class to reflect the top three authorization rules.

```ts{7-8,18}
// src/shared/Task.ts

import { Allow, Entity, Fields } from "remult"

@Entity<Task>("tasks", {
  allowApiCrud: Allow.authenticated,
  allowApiInsert: "admin",
  allowApiDelete: "admin"
})
export class Task {
  @Fields.uuid()
  id!: string

  @Fields.string({
    validate: (task) => task.title.length > 2 || "Too Short",
    allowApiUpdate: "admin"
  })
  title = ""

  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false
}
```

2. Let's give the user _"Jane"_ the `admin` role by modifying the `roles` array of her `validUsers` entry.

```ts{4}
// src/auth.ts

const validUsers = [
  { id: "1", name: "Jane", roles: ["admin"] },
  { id: "2", name: "Steve" }
]
```

**Sign in to the app as _"Steve"_ to test that the actions restricted to `admin` users are not allowed. :lock:**

## Role-based Authorization on the Frontend

From a user experience perspective it only makes sense that users that can't add or delete, would not see these buttons.

Let's reuse the same definitions on the Frontend.

We'll use the entity's metadata to only show the form if the user is allowed to insert

```tsx{4,13}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

<main>
  <Show when={taskRepo.metadata.apiInsertAllowed()}>
    <form onSubmit={addTask}>
      <input
        value={newTaskTitle()}
        placeholder="What needs to be done?"
        onInput={(e) => setNewTaskTitle(e.currentTarget.value)}
      />
      <button>Add</button>
    </form>
  </Show>
  ...
</main>
```

::: warning Import Show
This code requires adding an import of `Show` from `solid-js`.
:::

And let's do the same for the `delete` button:

```tsx{15,17}
// src/components/Todo.tsx

return (
  <div>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={task.completed}
      oninput={(e) => setCompleted(e.target.checked)}
    />
    <input
      value={task.title}
      onInput={(e) => setTasks(i(), "title", e.target.value)}
    />
    <button onClick={saveTask}>Save</button>
    <Show when={taskRepo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed()}>
      <button onClick={deleteTask}>Delete</button>
    </Show>
  </div>
```

This way we can keep the frontend consistent with the `api`'s Authorization rules

- Note We send the `task` to the `apiDeleteAllowed` method, because the `apiDeleteAllowed` option, can be sophisticated and can also be based on the specific item's values.



# SolidStart - Tutorial - Database

# Database

Up until now the todo app has been using a plain JSON file to store the list of tasks. **In production, we'd like to use a `Postgres` database table instead.**

::: tip Learn more
See the [Quickstart](https://remult.dev/docs/quickstart.html#connecting-a-database) article for the (long) list of relational and non-relational databases Remult supports.
:::

::: warning Don't have Postgres installed? Don't have to.
Don't worry if you don't have Postgres installed locally. In the next step of the tutorial, we'll configure the app to use Postgres in production, and keep using JSON files in our dev environment.

**Simply install `postgres-node` per step 1 below and move on to the [Deployment section of the tutorial](deployment.md).**
:::

1. Install `postgres-node` ("pg").

   ```sh
   npm i pg
   ```

2. Add the highlighted code to the `api` server module.

   ```ts{5,9-11}
   // src/api.ts

   //...

   import { createPostgresDataProvider } from "remult/postgres"

   export const api = remultSolidStart({
     //...
   dataProvider: createPostgresDataProvider({
       connectionString: "your connection string"
     })
   })
   ```



# SolidStart - Tutorial - Deployment

# Deployment

Let's deploy the todo app to [railway.app](https://railway.app/).

## Prepare for Production

Modify the highlighted code in the `src/api.ts` to prefer a `connectionString` provided by the production host's `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

```ts{4,6-8}
// src/api.ts

//...
const DATABASE_URL = process.env["DATABASE_URL"];
export const api = remultExpress({
 dataProvider: DATABASE_URL
   ? createPostgresDataProvider({ connectionString: DATABASE_URL })
   : undefined,
   //...
 })
```

::: warning Note
In order to connect to a local PostgresDB, add `DATABASE_URL` to an .env file, or simply replace `process.env["DATABASE_URL"]` with your `connectionString`.

If no `DATABASE_URL` has found, it'll fallback to our local JSON files.
:::

## Test Locally

To test the application locally run

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

Now navigate to http://localhost:3000 and test the application locally

## Deploy to Railway

In order to deploy the todo app to [railway](https://railway.app/) you'll need a `railway` account. You'll also need [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli#npm) installed, and you'll need to login to railway from the cli, using `railway login`.

Click enter multiple times to answer all its questions with the default answer

1. Create a Railway `project`.

   From the terminal in your project folder run:

   ```sh
   railway init
   ```

2. Select `Empty Project`
3. Set a project name.
4. Open the project on `railway` using:
   ```sh
   railway open
   ```
5. Click the `Add Service` and add:
   - a Postgres Database
   - an Empty service
6. Once that's done run the following command to upload the project to railway:
   ```sh
   railway up
   ```
   And select the empty service name that was just created to upload the source code to it.
7. Once completed, go back to the railway UI in the browser and select the created service (not the database)
8. Switch to the `variables` tab
9. Click on `+ New Variable`, and in the `VARIABLE_NAME` click `Add Reference` and select `DATABASE_URL`
10. Add another variable called `SESSION_SECRET` and set it to a random string, you can use an [online UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)
11. Switch to the `settings` tab
12. Under `Environment` click on `Generate Domain`
13. Click the `deploy` button to deploy the changes, and wait for the deployment to complete
14. Click on the newly generated url to open the app in the browser and you'll see the app live in production. (it may take a few minutes to go live)

::: warning Note
If you run into trouble deploying the app to Railway, try using Railway's [documentation](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/deployments).
:::

That's it - our application is deployed to production, play with it and enjoy.
