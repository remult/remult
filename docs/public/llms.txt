# Remult

> remult is a library for building full-stack TypeScript apps. 
Boost your TypeScript stack with SSOT entities and say goodbye to boilerplate code.

## Notes
 - SSOT stands for Single Source of Truth, this is the main concept of remult, you define once and use everywhere.
 - remult is not tightly coupled with any framework, it can be used with a lot of different stacks.
