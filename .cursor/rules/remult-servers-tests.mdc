When you want to do servers tests you have to be on the root of the repo.

And to do all servers test, you should do:
```
npm run build && npm run test-servers:setup-all && npm run build-tests && npm run test:ci
```

Check out the root `package.json` to see the commands.
because, when you focus on one server, you can optimise the main command.
For example, you don't need to run test-servers:setup-all, but you can use the dedicated one.
If there is no dedicated one, you can just skip the setup & build... You can directly run tests.

Also, you can run specific tests with `npm run test fastify` to do only fastify tests.
